<b>'39</b><br>
<br>
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers<br>
In the days when lands were few<br>
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn<br>
The sweetest sight ever seen.<br>
<br>
And the night followed dau<br>
And the story tellers say<br>
That the score brave souls inside<br>
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas<br>
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.<br>
<br>
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away<br>
Don't you hear me calling you<br>
Write your letters in the sand<br>
For the day I take your hand<br>
In the land that our grandchildren knew.<br>
<br>
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue<br>
The volunteers came home that day<br>
And they bring good news of a world so newly born<br>
Though their hearts so heavily weigh<br>
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away<br>
But my love this cannot be<br>
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year<br>
Your mother's eyes in your eyes cry to me.<br>
<br>
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away<br>
Don't you hear me calling you<br>
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand<br>
<br>
For my life<br>
Still ahead<br>
Pity Me.
