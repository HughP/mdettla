<b>ALL DEAD,  ALL DEAD</b><br>
<br>
She came without a farthing<br>
A babe without a name<br>
So much ado 'bout nothing<br>
Is what she's try to say<br>
So much ado my lover<br>
So many games we played<br>
Through ev'ry fleeted summer<br>
Through ev'ry precious day<br>
<br>
All dead all dead<br>
All the dreams we had<br>
And I wonder why I still live on<br>
All dead all dead<br>
And alone I'm spared<br>
My sweeter half instead<br>
All dead and gone all dead<br>
All dead all dead<br>
At the rainbow's end<br>
And still I hear her own sweet song<br>
All dead all dead<br>
Take me back again<br>
You know my little friend's<br>
All dead and gone<br>
<br>
Her ways are always with me<br>
I wander all the while<br>
But please you must forgive me<br>
I am old but still a child<br>
<br>
All dead all dead<br>
But I should not grieve<br>
In time it comes to ev'ryone<br>
All dead all dead<br>
But in hope I breathe<br>
Of course I don't believe<br>
You're dead and gone<br>
All dead and gone
