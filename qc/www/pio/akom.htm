<b>A Kind Of Magic</b><br>
(Roger Meddows-Taylor)<br>
<br>
It's a kind of  magic,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
A kind of magic,<br>
One dream, one soul, one prize,<br>
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
One shaft of light that shows the way,<br>
No mortal man can win this day,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
The bell that rings inside your mind,<br>
Is challenging the doors of time,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
The waiting seems eternity,<br>
The day will down of sanity,<br>
Is this the kind of magic,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
There can be only one,<br>
This rage that lasts a thousand years<br>
Will soon be done,<br>
This flame that burns inside of me,<br>
I'm here in secret harmonies<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
The bell that rings inside your mind,<br>
Is challenging the doors of time,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
The rage that lasts a thousand years,<br>
Will soon be, will soon be,<br>
Will soon be done,<br>
This is a kind of magic,<br>
There can be only one,<br>
The rage that lasts a thousand years,<br>
Will soon be done,<br>
Magic - it's a kind of magic,<br>
It's a kind of magic,<br>
Magic, magic, magic, magic,<br>
It's magic,<br>
It's a kind of magic.
