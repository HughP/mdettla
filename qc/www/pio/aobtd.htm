<b>Another One Bites The Dust</b><br>
<br>
Steve walks warily down the street,<br>
with the brim pulled way down low<br>
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,<br>
machine guns ready to go<br>
Are you ready, Are you ready for this<br>
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
To the sound of the beat<br>
<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
And another one gone, and another one gone<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Hey, I'm gonna get you too<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
<br>
How do you think I'm going to get along,<br>
without you, when you're gone<br>
You took me for everything that I had,<br>
and kicked me out on my own<br>
<br>
Are you happy, are you satisfied<br>
How long can you stand the heat<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
To the sound of the beat<br>
<br>
Refren<br>
<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man<br>
And bring him to the ground<br>
You can beat him<br>
You can cheat him<br>
You can treat him bad and leave him<br>
When he's down<br>
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you<br>
I'm standing on my own two feet<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
repeating the sound of the beat
