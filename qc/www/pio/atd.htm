<b>ACTION THIS DAY</b><br>
(Roger Meddows-Taylor)<br>
<br>
 Action<br>
This street honey is a mean street<br>
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak<br>
We've got criminals living in this street<br>
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping<br>
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record<br>
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring<br>
I gotta feeling, this world is using me<br>
This town honey is a dead town<br>
Living in this town honey is a let-down<br>
Coming to this town honey is a showdown<br>
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping<br>
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter<br>
Or a sight of a light at<br>
The end of a tunnel<br>
Still there's a feeling, this world is using me<br>
Action this day<br>
Action this night<br>
We've gotta learn to learn to live to love<br>
You can't say it ain't right<br>
Action this day<br>
Action this night<br>
You've got the power, you've got the power<br>
You've got the power to love and to live<br>
You can't say it ain't right<br>
Your mind honey is a bleak place<br>
Living in your mind's living in a blank space<br>
Your mind is coming from a rat race<br>
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping<br>
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record<br>
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring<br>
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me<br>
Action this day<br>
Action this night<br>
You've got the power, you've got the power<br>
You've got the power to love, to live<br>
You can't say it ain't right<br>
Action<br>
Action this day
