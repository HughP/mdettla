<b>BREAKTHRU</b> <br>
<br>
When love breaks up<br>
When the dawn light wakes up<br>
A new life is born<br>
Somehow i have to make this final breakthru... Now !<br>
  <br>
I wake up<br>
Feel just fine,<br>
Your face<br>
Fills my mind<br>
I get religion quick<br>
Cos you're looking divine<br>
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me,<br>
I'm under your thumb, under you're spell, can't you see,<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
If i could make you smile,<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.<br>
    <br>
Breakthru, these barriers of pain,<br>
Breakthru, to the sunshine from the rain,<br>
Make my feelings know towards you<br>
Turn my heart inside and out for you now<br>
Somehow,<br>
I have to make this final breakthru<br>
Now !<br>
  <br>
Your smile,<br>
Speaks books to me,<br>
I break up,<br>
With each and every one of your looks at me,<br>
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me,<br>
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me,<br>
I'm outta control, i wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
If i could make you smile,<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
That would really be a breakthru<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
If i could make you smile,<br>
If i could only reach you,<br>
That would really be a breakthru<br>
Breakthru, breakthru
