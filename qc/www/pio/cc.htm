<b>COOL CAT</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
You're  taking all the sunshine away<br>
Maiking out  like you're the mainline - I knew that<br>
Cos you're a  cool cat<br>
Tapping on  the toe with a new hat<br>
Just  cruising - driving along like a swing king<br>
Feeling the  beat of my heart<br>
Feeling the  beat of my heart<br>
You're a  cool cat<br>
Coming all  strong with all the chit-chat<br>
You're  alright<br>
Hanging out  and stealing all the limelight<br>
Messing with  the beat of my heart<br>
Messing with  the beat of my heart<br>
You used to  be a mean kid<br>
Making such  a deal of life<br>
You were  wishing and hoping and waiting to really hit the big time<br>
But did it  happen, happen, no<br>
You're  speeding too fast<br>
Slow down  Slow down<br>
You'd better  slow down<br>
Slow down<br>
You really  know how to set the mood<br>
And you  really get inside the groove<br>
Cool cat<br>
Tapping on  the toe with a new hat<br>
Just  cruising<br>
Driving  along like a swing king<br>
Feeling the  beat of my heart<br>
Feeling the  beat of my heart - yeah yeah<br>
Feeling the  beat of my heart
