<b>DEATH ON TWO LEGS</b><br>
<br>
You suck my blood like a leech<br>
You break the law and you breach<br>
You Screw my brain till it hurts<br>
You've taken all my money - you still want more<br>
<br>
Misguided old mule<br>
With your pigheaded riles<br>
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools<br>
Of the first division<br>
<br>
Death on two legs<br>
You're tearing me apart<br>
Death on two legs<br>
You never had a heart of your own<br>
<br>
Kill joy bad guy<br>
Big talking small fry<br>
You're just an old barrow-boy<br>
Have you found a new toy to replace me<br>
Can you face me<br>
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye<br>
<br>
Feel good are you satisfied<br>
Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)<br>
Is your conscience all right<br>
Does it plague you at night<br>
Do you feel good<br>
Feel good<br>
<br>
Talk like a big business tycoon<br>
But you're just a hot-air balloon<br>
So now one gives you a damn<br>
You're just an overgrown school-boy<br>
Let me tan your hide<br>
<br>
A dog with disease<br>
King of the sleaze<br>
Put your money where your mind is Mr. Know all<br>
Was the fin on your back part of the deal... (shark!)<br>
<br>
Death on two legs<br>
You're tearing me apart<br>
Death on two legs<br>
You never had a heart of your own<br>
(you never did, right from the start)<br>
<br>
Insane, should be put inside<br>
You're a sewer-rat decaying in a cesspool of pride<br>
Should be made unemployed<br>
Then make yourself null-and-oid<br>
Make me feel good<br>
I feel good
