<b>MAN MADE PARADISE</b>
<br><br>
I want to gaze into your eyes and see the fire in their glow<br>
But it's the same old story<br>
Want you to melt inside my arms like falling rain upon the snow<br>
But you say no you say no<br>
Want you to help me through deep waters when my ship is is a storm<br>
Want you to give me all the power like a king upon his throne<br>
But you don't care you don't care<br>
History repeats itself I seem to be all by myself again<br>
<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Paradise<br>
<br>
One day I'll look inside your mind and understand which way to go<br>
But it's the same old story<br>
When you refuse me all the time I'm suicidal on my own<br>
But you don't know you don't know<br>
I want to be beside you now lie in the sand and kiss your brow<br>
I want to fly beyond the moon and do the things we do for love<br>
But you don't care you don't care<br>
History repeats itself I seem to be all by myself again<br>
<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Come into my life it's a man made paradise<br>
Paradise<br>
<br>
I want to be beside you now lie in the sand and kiss your brow<br>
I want to fly beyond the moon and do the things we do for love<br>
But you don't care you don't care<br>
History repeats itself I seem to be all by myself again<br>
<br>
A capella
