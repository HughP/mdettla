<b>FATHER TO SON</b><br>
<br>
A word in your ear<br>
From father to son<br>
Hear the word that I say<br>
I fought with you<br>
Fought on your side<br>
Long before you were born<br>
Joyful the sound<br>
The word goes around<br>
From father to son<br>
<br>
And the voice is so clear<br>
Time after time it keeps<br>
Calling you calling you on<br>
Don't destroy what you see<br>
Your country to be<br>
Just keep building on the ground<br>
That's been won<br>
Kings will be crowned<br>
The word goes around<br>
From father to son to son<br>
<br>
Won't you hear us sing<br>
Our family song?<br>
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba<br>
Now we hand it on<br>
But I've heard it all before<br>
Take this letter that I give you<br>
Take it soney hold it high<br>
You won't understand a word that's in it<br>
But you'll write it all again before you die<br>
<br>
A word in you ear<br>
From father to son<br>
Funny you don't hear<br>
A single word that I say<br>
But my letter to you<br>
Will stay by my side<br>
Through the years<br>
Till the loneliness is gone<br>
<br>
Sing if you will<br>
But the air you breathe<br>
I live to give you<br>
Father to son father to son<br>
Father to son father to son<br>
Joyful the sound<br>
Word goes around<br>
Father to son to son<br>
Kings will be crowned<br>
Earth goes around<br>
Father to son to son<br>
<br>
Joyful the sound<br>
Word goes around<br>
Father to son to son<br>
Kings will be crowned<br>
Earth goes around<br>
Father to son to son
