<b>Friends Will Be Friends</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
Another red  letter day,<br>
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating,<br>
The other half ran away,<br>
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,<br>
Got a pain in the chest,<br>
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest.<br>
<br>
It's not easy  love, but you've got friends you can trust,<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,<br>
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.<br>
<br>
How it's  beautiful day,<br>
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,<br>
Only a phone call away,<br>
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number.<br>
As a matter of fact,<br>
You're getting used to life without him in your way.<br>
<br>
It's so easy  now, cos you got friends you can trust,<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,<br>
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.<br>
<br>
It's so easy  now, cos you got friends you can trust,<br>
Friends  will be friends,<br>
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,<br>
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.<br>
<br>
Friends will  be friends,<br>
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,<br>
Friends will be friends,<br>
When you're through with life and all hope is lost.<br>
Hold out your hand cos right till the end -<br>
friends will be friends.
