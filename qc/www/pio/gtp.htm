<b>Gimme The Prize</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
Here I am, I'm  the master of your destiny,<br>
I  am the one the only one, I am the god of kingdom come,<br>
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize,<br>
Give me your kings, let me squeeze theme in my hands,<br>
Your puny princes,<br>
Your so-called leaders of your land,<br>
I'll eat them whole beore I'm done,<br>
The battle's fought and the game is won,<br>
I am the one the only one,<br>
I am the god of kingdom come,<br>
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize,<br>
Move over, I said move over,<br>
Hey, hey, hey clear the way,<br>
There's no escape from authority - I tell you -<br>
I am the one the only one, I am the god of kingdom come,<br>
Gimme the prize. Just gimme the prize,<br>
I am the one the only one,<br>
I am the god of kingdom come,<br>
Gimme the prize.
