<b>Hammer To Fall</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
Here we  stand or here we fall<br>
History  won't care at all<br>
Make the  bed, light the light<br>
Lady Mercy  won't be home tonight.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; Chorus<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You don't  waste no time at all<br>
Don't hear  the bell but you answer the call<br>
It comes to  you as to us all<br>
We're just  waiting<br>
For the  hammer to fall<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Oh every  night, and every day<br>
A little  piece of you is falling away<br>
But lift  your face, the Western Way -<br>
Build your  muscles as your body decays.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; Chorus<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Toe your  line and play their game<br>
Let the  anaesthetic cover it all<br>
Till one day  they call your name<br>
You know  it's time for the Hammer to Fall.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Rich or poor  or famous for<br>
Your truth  it's all the same<br>
Lock your  door but rain is pouring<br>
Through your  window pane<br>
Baby now  your struggle's all vain.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For me who  grew up tall and proud<br>
In the  shadow of the Mushroom Cloud<br>
Convinced  our voices can't be heard<br>
We just  wanna scream it louder and louder<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; Chorus<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What the  hell we fighting for?<br>
Just  surrender and it won't hurt at all<br>
You just got  time to say your prayers<br>
While you're  waiting for the Hammer to Fall.
