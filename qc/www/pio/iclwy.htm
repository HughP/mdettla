<b>I Can't Live With You</b><br>
<br>
I can't live with you<br>
But I can't live without you -<br>
I can't let you stay<br>
But I can't live if you go away<br>
I don't know just how it goes<br>
All I know is I can't live with you<br>
I'm having a hard time<br>
I'm walking a fine line<br>
Between hope and despair<br>
You may think that I don't care -<br>
But I travelled a long road to<br>
Get a hold of my sorrow<br>
I tried to catch a dream<br>
But nothing's what it seems<br>
Love is saying baby it's all right<br>
When deep inside you're really petrified<br>
Lover turns to hater<br>
On this escalator<br>
I can't live with you<br>
But I can't live without you<br>
I can't breathe - if you stay<br>
But I can't bear you to go away<br>
I don't know what time it is<br>
All I know is I can't live with you<br>
We're stuck in a bad place<br>
We're trapped in a rat race<br>
And we can't escape<br>
Maybe there's been some mistake<br>
We're trying to make a high score<br>
We're walking through a closed door<br>
And nobody's winning -<br>
We're just sinning against ourselves<br>
Hold on baby tell me it's all right<br>
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside<br>
Passions screaming hotter<br>
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah<br>
I can't live with you,I can't live with you<br>
I can't live, I can't live<br>
I can't, I can't live with you<br>
But baby I'll never ever leave you<br>
I can't live with you<br>
But I can't live without you -<br>
Cause I'm in with you<br>
And everything about you<br>
I can't live with you<br>
No I just can't live, I just can't live<br>
I can't live with you,<br>
And I can't live without you<br>
Through the madness , through the tears<br>
We've still got each other<br>
For a million years
