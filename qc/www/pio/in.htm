<b>IN THE LAP OF THE GODS... revisited</b><br>
<br>
It's so easy, but I can't do it<br>
So risky - But I gotta chance it<br>
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about<br>
My money, that's all you want to talk about<br>
I can see what you want me to be<br>
But I'm no fool<br>
<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
I can see what you want me to be<br>
But I'm no fool<br>
<br>
No beginning, there's no ending<br>
There's no meaning in my pretending<br>
Believe me, life goes on and on and on<br>
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong<br>
You say I  can't set you free from me<br>
But that's not true<br>
<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
I can see what you want me to be<br>
But I'm no fool<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
But that's not true<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
But I'm no fool<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods<br>
But I'm no fool<br>
It's in the lap of the Gods
