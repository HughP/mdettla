<b>In Only Seven Days</b><br>
<br>
Monday the start of my holiday<br>
Freedom for just one week<br>
Feels good to get away ooh<br>
<br>
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach<br>
I stood and watched a while<br>
And she looked and smiled at me<br>
<br>
Wednesday I didn't see her<br>
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow<br>
And then on Thursday<br>
My luck had changed<br>
She stood there all alone<br>
I went and asked her name<br>
I never thought that this could happen to me<br>
In only seven days<br>
It would take a hundred or more<br>
For memories to fade<br>
<br>
I wish Friday would last for ever<br>
I held her close to me<br>
I couldn't bear to leave her there<br>
<br>
Saturday just twenty four hours<br>
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday<br>
<br>
Ooh so sad alone
