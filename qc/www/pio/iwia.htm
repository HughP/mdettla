<b>I WANT IT ALL</b><br>
  <br>
Adventure seeker on an empty street<br>
Just an alley creeper light on his feet<br>
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt<br>
With the pain and anger can't see a way out<br>
It ain't much I'm asking I heard him say<br>
Gotta find me a future move out of my way<br>
I want it all I want it all I want it all and I want it now<br>
I want it all I want it all I want it all and I want it now<br>
<br>
Listen all you people come gather round<br>
I gotta get me a game plan gotta shake you to the ground<br>
Just give me what I know is mine<br>
People do you hear me just give me the sign<br>
It ain't much I'm asking if you want the truth<br>
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth<br>
I want it all (give it all) I want it all I want it all and I want it now<br>
I want it all (yes I want it all) I want it all (hey)<br>
I want it all and I want it now<br>
<br>
I'm a man with a one track mind<br>
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)<br>
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies<br>
So I'm living it all (yes I'm living it all)<br>
And I'm giving it all (and I'm giving it all)<br>
<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
I want it all all all all<br>
<br>
It ain't much I'm asking if you want the truth<br>
Here's to the future<br>
Hear the cry of youth (hear the cry hear the cry of youth)<br>
I want it all I want it all I want it all and I want it now<br>
I want it all (yeah yeah yeah) I want it all I want it all and I want it<br>
now<br>
<br>
I want it<br>
Now<br>
I want it I want it
