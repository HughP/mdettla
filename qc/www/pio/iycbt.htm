<b>If You Can't Beat Them</b><br>
<br>
Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely<br>
Don't let them get you down<br>
Ain't no use in sitting all alone<br>
Hangin' around for someone to call<br>
Ohh they won't come knocking at all<br>
Don't run and hide even if it hurts you inside<br>
So I said give as good as you get<br>
<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
You better do it 'cos it makes you feel good<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
You're never gonna help yourself<br>
<br>
Keep your fingers off my money<br>
Don't try and pull me down<br>
You're taking me out to wine and dine me<br>
Trying to wind me round and around<br>
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!<br>
Rumour has it that you could play dirty<br>
I tell you what I'll do about that<br>
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!<br>
<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
You've got to do it 'cos it makes you feel good<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
You're never gonna help yourself<br>
<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
You've got to do it 'cos it makes you feel good<br>
If you can't beat them join them<br>
It's everyone for themselves
