<b>JESUS</b><br>
<br>
And then I saw Him in the crowd<br>
A lot of people had gathered round Him<br>
The beggars shouted and the lepers called Him<br>
The old man said nothing<br>
He just stared about Him<br>
<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down<br>
<br>
Then came a man before His feet he fell<br>
Unclean said the leper<br>
And rang his bell<br>
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head<br>
Go now go now you're a new man instead<br>
<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down<br>
<br>
It all began with the three wise men<br>
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem<br>
And made it heard throughout out the land<br>
Born was the leader of man<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down<br>
<br>
It all began with the three wise men<br>
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem<br>
And made it heard throughout out the land<br>
Born was the leader of man<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down to see the Lord Jesus<br>
All going down...
