<b>Keep Passing The Open Windows</b><br>
(Freddie Mercury)<br>
<br>
This is the  only life for me<br>
Surround  myself around my own fantasy<br>
You just  gotta be strong and believe in yourself<br>
Forget all  the sadness cause love is all you need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Do you know  what it's like to be alone in this world<br>
When you're  down and out on your luck and you're a failure<br>
Wake up  screaming in the middle of the night<br>
You think  it's all been a waste of time<br>
It's been a  bad year<br>
You start  believing everything's gonna be alright<br>
Next minute  you're down and you're flat on your back<br>
A brand new  day is beginning<br>
Get that  sunny feeling and you're on your way.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just believe  - just keep passing the open windows<br>
Just believe  - just keep passing the open windows<br>
Do you know  how it feels when you don't have a friend<br>
Without a  job and no money to spend<br>
You're a  stranger<br>
&nbsp;<br>
All you  think about is suicide<br>
One of these  days you're gonna lose the fight<br>
You better  keep out of danger - yeah<br>
That same  old feeling just keep burning deep inside<br>
You keep  telling yourself it's gonna be the end<br>
Oh get  yourself together<br>
Things are  looking better everyday<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just believe  - keep passing the open windows<br>
Just believe  - keep passing the open windows<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is the  only life for me<br>
Surround  myself around my own fantasy<br>
You just  gotta be strong and believe in yourself<br>
Forget all  the sadness cause love is all you need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You just  gotta be strong and believe in yourself<br>
Forget all  the sadness cause love is all you need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Love is all  you need - baby - love is all you need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just believe  - just keep passing the open windows.
