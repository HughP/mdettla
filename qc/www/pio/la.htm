<b>LONG AWAY</b><br>
<br>
You might believe in heaven<br>
I would not care to say<br>
For every star in heaven<br>
There's a sad soul here today<br>
Wake up in the morning with a good face<br>
Stare at the moon all day<br>
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase<br>
Does anyone care anyway?<br>
For all the prayers in heaven<br>
So much of life's this way<br>
<br>
Did we leave our way behind us?<br>
Such a long long way behind us<br>
Who knows when now who knows where<br>
Where the light of day will find us?<br>
Look for the day<br>
<br>
Take heart my friend we love you<br>
Though it seems like you're alone<br>
A million light's above you<br>
Smile down upon your home<br>
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase<br>
Come let the new child play<br>
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase<br>
I'm leaving here,I'm long away<br>
For all the stars in heaven<br>
I would not live I could not live this way<br>
<br>
Did we leave our way behind us?<br>
Such a long long way behind us<br>
Leave it for some hopeless lane<br>
Such a long long way such a long long way<br>
Such a long long way I'm looking for<br>
Still looking for that day
