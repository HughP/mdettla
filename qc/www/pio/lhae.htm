<b>Leaving Home Ain't Easy</b><br>
<br>
I take a step outside<br>
And I breath the air<br>
And I slam the door<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
I won't lay no blame<br>
I won't call you names<br>
'Cause I've made my break<br>
And I won't look back<br>
I've turned my back<br>
On those endless games<br>
<br>
I'm all through with ties<br>
I'm all tired of tears<br>
I'm a happy man<br>
Don't it look that way<br>
Shakin' dust from my shoes<br>
There's a road ahead<br>
And there's no way back home (no way back home)<br>
Oh but I have to say<br>
<br>
Leavin' home ain't easy<br>
Oh I never thought it would be easy<br>
Leavin' on your own<br>
Oh is the main thing calling me back<br>
Leavin' home ain't easy<br>
On the one you're leavin' home<br>
<br>
Stay my love my love please stay<br>
Stay my love what's wrong my love?<br>
What's right my love?<br>
Oh leavin' home ain't easy<br>
I thought how could I think of leavin'<br>
Leavin' on your own<br>
Still tryin' to persuade me that<br>
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way<br>
Leavin' home ain't easy<br>
But may be the only way
