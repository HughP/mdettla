<b>LILY OF THE VALLEY</b><br>
<br>
I am forever searching high and low<br>
But why does ev'ryone tell me no<br>
Neptune of the seas an answer for me please<br>
The lily of the valley doesn't know<br>
<br>
I lie in wait with open eyes<br>
I carry on thru' stormy skies<br>
I follow ev'ry course my kingdom for a horse<br>
But each time I grow old<br>
Serpent of the Nile relieve me for a while<br>
And cast me from your spell and let me go<br>
<br>
Messenger from seven seas has flown<br>
To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne<br>
Wars will never cease<br>
Is there time enough for peace?<br>
The lily of the valley doesn't know
