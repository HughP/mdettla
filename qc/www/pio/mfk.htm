<b>MY FAIRY KING</b><br>
<br>
In the land where horses<br>
Born with eagle wings<br>
And honey bees have lost their stings<br>
There's singing forever<br>
Lion's den with fallow deer<br>
And rivers made from wine so clear<br>
Flow on and on forever<br>
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air<br>
And baby lambs where Samson dares<br>
To go on on on on on on<br>
<br>
(Pierwszy g這s)<br>
My fairy king<br>
Can see things<br>
(Drugi g這s)<br>
He rules the air and turns the tides<br>
(Pierwszy g這s)<br>
That are not there for you and me<br>
(Drugi g這s)<br>
Ohh yeah he guides the winds<br>
<br>
My fairy king<br>
Can do right and nothing wrong<br>
Then came man<br>
To savage in the night<br>
To run like thieves<br>
And to kill like knives<br>
To take away the power<br>
From the magic hand<br>
To bring about the ruin<br>
To the promised land<br>
<br>
They turn the milk into sour<br>
Like the blue in the blood of my veins<br>
<br>
Why can't you see it<br>
<br>
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry<br>
Of screaming pain<br>
Son of heaven set me free and let me go<br>
Sea turn dry no salt from sand<br>
Seasons fly no helping hand<br>
Teeth don't shine like pearls<br>
For the poor man's eyes<br>
<br>
Someone someone<br>
Has drained the colour from my wings<br>
Broken my fairy circle ring<br>
And shamed the king in all his pride<br>
Changed the winds<br>
And wronged the tides<br>
Mother mercury (mercury)<br>
Look what they've done to me<br>
I cannot run I cannot hide
