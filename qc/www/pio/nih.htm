<b>NOW I'M HERE</b><br>
<br>
Here I stand<br>
Look around around around around<br>
But you won't see me<br>
Now I'm here<br>
Now I'm there<br>
I'm just a just a new man<br>
Yes you made me live again<br>
<br>
A baby I was when you took my hand<br>
And the light of the night burned bright<br>
And the people all stared didn't understand<br>
But you knew my name on sight<br>
Whatever came of you and me?<br>
America's new bride to be<br>
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound<br>
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me<br>
Don't I love her so?<br>
Yes she made me live again Yeah!<br>
<br>
A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky<br>
Where the beams of your love light chase<br>
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain<br>
With the rain running down my face<br>
Your matches still light up the sky<br>
And many a tear lives on in my eye<br>
Down in the city just Hoople and me<br>
Don't I love him so don't I love him so?<br>
<br>
Whatever comes of you and me<br>
I love to leave my memories with you<br>
<br>
Now I'm here<br>
Think I'll stay around around around<br>
Down in the city just you and me<br>
Don't I love you so?<br>
Go, go, go, little Queenie
