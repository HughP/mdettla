<b>Need Your Loving Tonight</b><br>
<br>
No I'll never, look back in anger,<br>
No I'll never, find me an answer,<br>
You promised me, you'd keep in touch<br>
I read your letter and it hurt me so much<br>
I said I'd never, never be angry with you.<br>
<br>
I don't wnna feel like a stranger<br>
Cos I'd rather be in danger<br>
I read your letter so many times<br>
I got your meaning between the lines<br>
I said I'd never, never be angry with you<br>
<br>
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her<br>
<br>
I only hope as time goes on, I'll forget her<br>
My body's aching, can't sleep at night<br>
I'm too exhausted to start a fight<br>
And if I see her with another guy<br>
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her,<br>
love her, love her, love her<br>
<br>
Come on baby, let's get together<br>
I'll love you baby, I'll love you forever<br>
I'm trying hard, to stay away<br>
What made you change, what did I say?<br>
Ooh I need your loving tonight
