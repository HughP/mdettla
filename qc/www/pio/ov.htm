When I was young,<br>
A dream of sweet illusion,<br>
A glimpse of hope and unity,<br>
And visions of one sweet union,<br>
But a cold wind blows,<br>
And a dark rain falls,<br>
And in my heart it shows,<br>
Look what they've done to my dream.<br>

So give me  your hands,<br>
Give me your hearts,<br>
I'm ready,<br>
There's only one direction,<br>
One world one nation,<br>

No hate no  fight,<br>
Just excitation,<br>
All through the night<br>
