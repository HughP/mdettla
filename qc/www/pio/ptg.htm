<b>Play The Game</b><br>
<br>
Open up your mind and let me step inside<br>
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide<br>
It's so easy when you know the rules<br>
It's so easy all you have to do<br>
Is fall in love<br>
Play the game,<br>
Everybody play the game of love<br>
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low<br>
Light another cigarette and let yourself go<br>
This is your life<br>
Don't play hard to get<br>
It's a free world<br>
All you have to do is fall in love<br>
Play the game, everybody play the game of love<br>
My game of love has just begun<br>
Love runs from head down to mt toes<br>
My love is pumping through my veins<br>
Driving me insane<br>
Come come come play the game<br>
This is your life - don;t play hard to get<br>
It's a free world all you have to do is fall in love<br>
Play the game
