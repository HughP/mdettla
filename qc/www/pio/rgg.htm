<b>Radio Ga-Ga</b><br>
(Roger Meddows-Taylor)<br>
<br>
I'd sit  alone and watch your light<br>
My only  friend through teenage nights<br>
And  everything I had to know<br>
I heard it  on my radio<br>
Radio.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You gave  them all those old time stars<br>
Through wars  of worlds - invaded by Mars<br>
You made 'em  laugh - you made 'em cry<br>
You made us  feel like we could fly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So don't  become some background noise<br>
A backdrop  for the girls and boys<br>
Who just  don't know or just don't care<br>
And just  complain when you're not there<br>
You had your  time, you had the power<br>
You've yet  to have your finest hour<br>
Radio.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
All we hear  is Radio ga-ga<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio goo-goo<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio ga-ga<br>
All we hear  is Radio ga-ga<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio blah blah<br>
Radio what's  new?<br>
Radio,  someone still loves you!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We watch the  shows - we watch the stars<br>
On videos  for hours and hours<br>
We hardly  need to use our ears<br>
How music  changes through the years.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Let's hope  you never leave old friend<br>
Like all  good things on you we depend<br>
So stick  around cos we might miss you<br>
When we grow  tired of all this visual<br>
You had your  time - you had the power<br>
You've yet  to have your finest hour<br>
Radio -  Radio.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
All we hear  is Radio ga-ga<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio goo-goo<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio ga-ga<br>
All we hear  is Radio ga-ga<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio goo-goo<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio ga-ga<br>
All we hear  is Radio ga-ga<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Radio blah blah<br>
Radio what's  new?<br>
Radio,  someone still loves you!
