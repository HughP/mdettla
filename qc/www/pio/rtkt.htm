<b>KILLING TIME</b><br>
<br>
I live on a satellite<br>
Sun shines on a sea of steel<br>
Ice-men in kryptonite<br>
Cavemen on wheels<br>
Here in our own small way<br>
Just passing the time of day<br>
Time goes by and we're treading the same old wheel<br>
Killing what we can't steal<br>
Days go by just killing time<br>
Days go by<br>
<br>
I'm living in paradise<br>
Sunset across the shield<br>
Paradise ain't so nice<br>
Some raw deal<br>
Here in our own sweet way<br>
Passing the time of day<br>
Time goes by and we're treading the same old wheel<br>
Smothering all that's real<br>
Ring the bell it's killing time<br>
Killing time killing time<br>
<br>
Years go by<br>
Just killing time just killing time<br>
<br>
I'm taking a fast flight<br>
Straight course through the force fields<br>
I've seen the real sights<br>
Cavemen appeal<br>
Here in our own small way<br>
Passing the time of day<br>
Time goes by and we're treading the same old wheel<br>
Smile but we just don't feel<br>
All fall down it's killing time<br>
<br>
Days go by killing time<br>
Just killing time Just killing time<br>
Time
