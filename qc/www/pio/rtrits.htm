<b>RACING IN THE STREET</b><br>
<br>
I got a 69 Chevy with a 396<br>
Fuellie heads and a Hurst on the floor<br>
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot<br>
Outside the seven eleven store<br>
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch<br>
And he rides with me from town to town<br>
We only run for the money got no strings attached<br>
We set 'em up and then we shut 'em down<br>
Tonight tonight the strips just right<br>
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat<br>
Summer's here and the time is right<br>
For racing in the street<br>
<br>
We take all the action we can meet<br>
And we cover all the north east states<br>
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street<br>
From the fire roads to the interstate<br>
Now some guys they just give up livin'<br>
And start dyin' little by little piece by piece<br>
Some guys come home from work and wash up<br>
And go racing in the street<br>
Tonight tonight the strips just right<br>
I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats<br>
Callin' out around the world<br>
We're goin' racing in the street<br>
<br>
I met her on the strip three years ago<br>
In a Camero with this dude from L.A.<br>
I blew that Camero off my back<br>
And drove that little girl away<br>
But now there's wrinkles round my baby's eyes<br>
And she cries herself to sleep at night<br>
When I come home the house is dark<br>
She sighs 'baby did you make it alright?'<br>
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house<br>
But all her pretty dreams are torn<br>
She stares off alone into the night<br>
With the eyes of one who hates for just bein' born<br>
For all the shut-down strangers and hot-rod angels<br>
Rumblin' through this promised land<br>
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea<br>
And wash these sins off our hands<br>
Tonight tonight the highway's bright<br>
Out of our way mister you best keep<br>
Summer's here and the time is right<br>
For racing in the street<br>
<br>
Tonight tonight the strip's just right<br>
I'm gonna blow 'em all outa their seats<br>
'Cos summer's here and the time is right<br>
For racing in the street<br>
In the street - in the street - in the street - in the street
