<b>Ride The Wild Wind</b><br>
<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
(Push the envelope don't sit on the fence)<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
(Live life on the razors edge)<br>
Gonna ride the whirlwind<br>
It ain't dangerous - enough for me<br>
Get your head down baby - we're gonna ride tonight<br>
Your angel eyes are shining bright<br>
I wanna take your hand - lead you from this place<br>
Gonna leave it all behind<br>
Check out of this rat race -<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
Gonna ride the whirlwind -<br>
It ain't dangerous - enough for me<br>
Tie your hair back baby -<br>
We're gonna ride tonight<br>
We got freaks to the left - we got jerks to the right<br>
Sometimes I get so low - I just have to ride<br>
Let me take your hand<br>
Let me be your guide<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
(Don't sit on the fence)<br>
Ride the wild wind<br>
(Live life on the razors edge)<br>
Gonna ride the whirlwind<br>
It ain't dangerous - enough for me<br>
<br>
Ride the wild wind
