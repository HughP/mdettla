<b>Sail Away Sweet Sister (To The Sister I Never Had)</b><br>
<br>
Hey little babe you're changing<br>
Babe, are you feeling sore?<br>
Ain't no use in pretending<br>
You don't wanna play no more<br>
<br>
It's plain that you ain't no baby<br>
What would your mother say<br>
You're all dressed up like a lady<br>
How come you behave this way<br>
<br>
Sail Away Sweet Sister<br>
Sail across the sea<br>
Maybe you find somebody<br>
Who loves you half as much as me<br>
My heart is always with you<br>
No matter what you do<br>
Sail away sweet sister<br>
Always be in love with you<br>
<br>
Forgive me for what I told you<br>
My heart makes a fool of me<br>
You know I'll never hold you<br>
I know that you gotta be free<br>
<br>
Sail Away Sweet Sister<br>
Sail across the sea<br>
Maybe you find somebody<br>
Who loves you half as much as me<br>
Take it the way you want it<br>
But when they let you down my friend<br>
Sail away sweet sister<br>
Back to my arms again<br>
<br>
Hot child don't you know, you're young -<br>
You've got your whole life ahead of you<br>
Oohah - You can throw it away too soon<br>
Way too soon
