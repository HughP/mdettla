<b>SOME DAY ONE DAY</b><br>
<br>
You never heard my song before<br>
The music was too loud<br>
But now I think you hear me well<br>
For now we both know how<br>
No star can light our way<br>
In this cloud of dark and fear<br>
But someday one day<br>
<br>
Funny how he pages turn<br>
And hold us in between<br>
A misty castle waits for you<br>
And you shall be a queen<br>
Today the cloud it hangs<br>
Over us and all is grey<br>
But someday one day<br>
<br>
When I was you and you were me<br>
And we were very young<br>
Together took us nearly there <br>
The rest may not be sung<br>
So still the cloud it hangs<br>
Over us and we're alone<br>
But someday one day<br>
We'll come home
