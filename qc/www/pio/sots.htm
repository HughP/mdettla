<b>SLEAPING ON THE SIDEWALK</b><br>
<br>
I was nothin' but a city boy<br>
My trumpet was my only toy<br>
I've been blowin' my horn<br>
Since I knew I was born<br>
But there ain't nobody wants to know<br>
<br>
I've been<br>
Sleepin' on the sidewalk<br>
Rollin' down the road<br>
I may get hungry<br>
But I sure don't want to go home<br>
<br>
So round the corner comes a limousine<br>
And the biggest grin I've ever seen<br>
Come on sonny won't you sign<br>
Right along the dotted lin<br>
What you sayin' Are you playin'<br>
Sure you don't mean me?<br>
<br>
Sleepin' on the sidewalk<br>
Rollin' down the road<br>
I may get hungry<br>
But I sure don't wanna go home<br>
<br>
(tell you what happened. . .)<br>
<br>
They took me to a room without a table<br>
They said "blow your trumpet into here"<br>
I played around as well as I was able<br>
And soon we had the record of the year<br>
<br>
I was a legend all through the land<br>
I was blowin' to a million fans<br>
Nothin' was a-missin' <br>
All the people want to listen<br>
You'd have thought I was a happy man<br>
<br>
And I was<br>
Sleepin' like a princess<br>
Never touch the road<br>
I don't get hungry<br>
And I sure don't want to go home<br>
(have to have some fun. . .)<br>
<br>
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable<br>
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year<br>
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label<br>
It's just me and the road from here<br>
<br>
Back to playin' and layin'<br>
I'm back on the game<br>
<br>
Sleepin' on the sidewalk<br>
Rollin' down the road<br>
I sure get hungry and I<br>
Sure do wanna go home<br>
(Yeah)
