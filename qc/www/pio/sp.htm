<b>STAYING POWER</b><br>
(Freddie Mercury) <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Let me show  it to you<br>
See what I  got<br>
I got a hell  of a lot<br>
Tell me what  you feel<br>
Is it real<br>
Is it real<br>
You know I  got what it takes<br>
And I can  take a lot<br>
Did you hear  the last call baby<br>
You and me  got staying power<br>
You and me  we got staying power<br>
Staying  power I got it I got it<br>
I wonder  when we're gonna make it<br>
I wonder  when we're gonna shake it<br>
Rock me baby  rock me<br>
C'mon you  can shock me<br>
Let's catch  on to the groove<br>
Make it  move, make it move<br>
You know how  to shake that thing<br>
We'll work  it, work it, work it<br>
You and I  can play ball baby<br>
You and me  got staying power<br>
You and me  we got staying power<br>
I wonder  when we're gonna make it<br>
I wonder  when we're gonna shake it<br>
I've got  fire down below<br>
I'm just a  regular dynamo<br>
Want some  smooth company<br>
Don't loose  control just hang on out with me<br>
Got to get  to know each other<br>
But we got  plenty of time<br>
Did you hear  the last call baby<br>
You and me  got staying power<br>
You and me  we got staying power<br>
Power<br>
I wonder  where we gonna stick it<br>
I wonder  when we gonna trick it<br>
Blow baby  blow<br>
Let's get  down and go go<br>
Get yourself  in the mood<br>
Got to give  a little bit of attitude<br>
Baby don't  you crash<br>
Let's just  trash trash trash<br>
Did you hear  the last call baby<br>
You and me  got staying power<br>
You and me  we got staying power<br>
Staying  power... got'cha
