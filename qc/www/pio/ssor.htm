<b>SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE</b><br>
<br>
Fear me you lords and lady preachers<br>
I descend upon your earth from the skies<br>
I command your very souls you unbelievers<br>
Bring before me what is mine<br>
The seven seas of Rhye<br>
<br>
Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors<br>
I stand before you naked to the eyes<br>
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust<br>
I swear that you'll be mine<br>
At the seven seas of Rhye<br>
<br>
Sister I live and lie for you<br>
Mister do and I'll die<br>
You are mine I possess you<br>
Belong [or Make love] to you forever<br>
<br>
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through<br>
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive<br>
I'll survive I'll survive<br>
Then I'll defy the laws of nature<br>
And come out alive<br>
Begone with you you shod and shady senators<br>
Give out [or you] the good and leave out the bad evil cries<br>
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours<br>
And with a smile<br>
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
