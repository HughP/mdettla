<b>THE FAIRY FELLER MASTER STROKE</b><br>
<br>
He's a fairy feller<br>
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered<br>
Round the new moon's shine<br>
To see the feller crack a nut<br>
At night's noon time<br>
To swing his axe he swears<br>
As he climbs he dares<br>
To deliver the master stroke<br>
<br>
Ploughman wagoner will and types<br>
Politician with sentorial pipe<br>
He's a dilly dally oh<br>
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown<br>
And a satyr peers under lady's gown<br>
He's a dirty fellow<br>
What a dirty laddie-oh<br>
<br>
Tatterdemalion and the junketer<br>
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter<br>
He's my hero ah<br>
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy<br>
Of his lady friend<br>
The nymph in yellow can we see the master stroke<br>
What a quaere fellow<br>
<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah ah<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah ah<br>
Soldier sailor tinker tailor ploughboy<br>
Waiting to hear the sound<br>
And the arch magician presides<br>
He is the leader<br>
<br>
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan<br>
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man<br>
Come to say hello<br>
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy<br>
Of his lady friend<br>
The nymph in yellow can we see the master stroke<br>
What a quaere fellow<br>
The ostler stares with hands on his knees<br>
Come on mister feller<br>
Crack it open if you please
