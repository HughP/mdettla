<b>Tear It Up</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
Are you  ready? - well are you ready?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Give me your  mind baby give me your body<br>
Give me some  time baby let's have a party<br>
It ain't no  time for sleepin' baby<br>
Soon it's  round your street I,m creeping<br>
- You better  be ready -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We gonna&nbsp;  Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Stir it up<br>
 &nbsp; Break it up - Baby -<br>
You gotta  Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Shake it up<br>
 &nbsp; Make it up - as you go along.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Square it up<br>
 &nbsp; Wake it up - Baby.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Stir it up<br>
 &nbsp; Stake it out - and you can't go wrong.<br>
(Hey)<br>
I love you  cos you're sweet and I love you cos you're naughtly<br>
I love you  for you mind but give me your body<br>
I wanna be a  toy at your birthday party<br>
Wind me up -  wind me up - wind me up - let me go -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Stir it up<br>
 &nbsp; Break it up - let me go.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Shake it up<br>
 &nbsp; Make it up - as you go along.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; Tear it up<br>
 &nbsp; Turn it up<br>
 &nbsp; Burn it up.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Baby baby  baby are you ready for me? (Oh yeah)<br>
Baby baby  baby are you ready for love? (Oh yeah)<br>
Are you  ready - are you ready - are you ready for me? (Oh yeah)<br>
