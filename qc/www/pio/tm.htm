<b>THE MIRACLE</b> <br>
<br>
Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all<br>
It's a miracle<br>
All God's creations great and small<br>
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal<br>
That's a miracle<br>
Test tube babies being born<br>
Mothers, fathers dead and gone<br>
It's a miracle<br>
<br>
We're having a miracle on earth<br>
Mother nature does it all for us<br>
The wonders of this world go on<br>
The hanging Gardens of Babylon<br>
Captain Cook and Cain and Able<br>
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel<br>
It's a miracle it's a miracle it's a miracle<br>
It's a miracle<br>
<br>
The one thing we're all waiting for is peace on earth - an end to war<br>
It's a miracle we need - the miracle<br>
The miracle we're all waiting for today<br>
<br>
If every leaf on every tree could tell a story that would be a miracle<br>
If every child on every street had clothes to wear and food to eat<br>
That's a miracle<br>
If all God's people could be free to live in perfect harmony<br>
It's a miracle<br>
<br>
We're having a miracle on earth<br>
Mother nature does it all for us<br>
Open hearts and surgery<br>
(wonders of this world go on)<br>
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea<br>
Super powers always fighting<br>
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling<br>
It's a miracle it's a miracle it's a miracle<br>
<br>
(wonders of this world go on)<br>
It's a miracle it's a miracle it's a miracle<br>
It's a miracle<br>
<br>
The one thing (the one thing) we're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)<br>
Is peace on earth (peace on earth) and an end to war (an end to war)<br>
It's a miracle we need - the miracle<br>
The miracle peace on earth and end to war today<br>
<br>
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends<br>
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends<br>
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends<br>
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
