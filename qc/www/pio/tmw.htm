<b>THE MILIONAIRE WALTZ</b><br>
<br>
Bring out the charge of the love brigade<br>
There is spring in the air once again<br>
Drink to the sound of the song parade<br>
There is music and love ev'rywhere<br>
Give a little love to me<br>
(I wanna) Take a little love from me<br>
I want to share it with you<br>
<br>
Feel like a millionaire<br>
Once we were mad we were happy<br>
We spent all our days holding hands together<br>
Do you remember my love<br>
How we danced and played?<br>
In the rain we laid<br>
We could stay there for ever and ever<br>
Now I am sad you are so far away<br>
I sit counting the hours day by day<br>
Come back to me<br>
How I long for your love<br>
Come back to me<br>
Be happy like we used to be<br>
<br>
Come back come back to me<br>
Come back come back to me<br>
Oh come back to me oh my love<br>
How I long for your love<br>
Won't you come back to me?<br>
<br>
My fine friend<br>
Take me wiz you unt love me forever<br>
My fine friend<br>
Forever forever<br>
<br>
Bring out the charge of the love brigade<br>
There is spring in the air once again<br>
Drink to the sound of the song parade<br>
There is music and love ev'rywhere<br>
Give a little love to me<br>
(I wanna) Take a little love from me<br>
I want to share it with you<br>
Come back come back to me feel<br>
Make me feel like a millionaire
