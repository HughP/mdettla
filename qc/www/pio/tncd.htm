<b>THE NIGHT COMES DOWN</b><br>
<br>
When I was young it came to me<br>
And I could see the sun breakin'<br>
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling<br>
<br>
Holding the world inside<br>
Once I believed in everyone<br>
Everyone and anyone can see<br>
<br>
Oh oh the night comes down<br>
And I get afraid of losing my way<br>
Oh oh the night comes down<br>
Oooh and it's dark again<br>
<br>
Once I could laugh with everyone<br>
Once I could see the good in me<br>
<br>
The black and the white<br>
Distinctively colouring<br>
Holding the world inside<br>
Now all the world is grey to me<br>
Nobody can see <br>
You gotta believe it<br>
<br>
Oh oh the night comes down<br>
And I get afraid of losing my way<br>
Oh oh the night comes dow<br>
Oooh and it's dark again<br>
And it's dark again<br>
And it's dark
