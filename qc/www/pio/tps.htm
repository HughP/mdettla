<b>THE PROPHET'S SONG</b><br>
<br>
Oh oh people of the earth<br>
Listen to the warning the seer he said<br>
Beware the storm that gathers here<br>
Listen to the wise man<br>
<br>
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair<br>
Spreading his hand to the multitude there<br>
A man who cried for a love gone stale<br>
And ice cold hearts of charity bare<br>
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze<br>
Hopes of the young in troubled graves<br>
'I see no day' I heard him say<br>
So grey is the face of every mortal<br>
<br>
Oh oh people of the earth!<br>
'Listen to the warning' the prophet he said<br>
For soon the cold of night will fall<br>
Summoned by your own hand<br>
<br>
Ah ah children of the land<br>
Quicken to the new life take my hand<br>
Fly and find the new green bough<br>
Return like the white dove<br>
<br>
He told of death as a bone white haze<br>
Taking the lost and the unloved babe<br>
Late too late all the wretches run<br>
These kings of beasts now counting their days<br>
From mother's love is the son estranged<br>
Married his own his precious gain<br>
The earth will shake in two will break<br>
And death all round will be your dow'ry<br>
<br>
Oh oh people of the earth<br>
Listen to the warning the seer he said<br>
For those who hear and mark my words<br>
Listen to the good plan<br>
<br>
Oh oh  - and two by two my human zoo<br>
They'll be<br>
running for to come<br>
Running for to come<br>
out of the rain<br>
<br>
Flee for your live,<br>
Who heed me not, let all your treasures make you<br>
Ffear for your life<br>
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you<br>
Should death await you<br>
<br>
Ah people can you hear me?<br>
And now I know and now I know<br>
And now I know and now I know<br>
That you can hear me<br>
And now I know and now I know<br>
And now I know <br>
Now I know<br>
The earth will shake in two will break<br>
Death all around around around around<br>
Around around around around<br>
Now I know<br>
Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo<br>
Listen to the wise listen to the wise listen to the wise<br>
Listen to the wise listen to the wise man<br>
La la<br>
La la la la la la<br>
La la<br>
La la<br>
La la<br>
Come here I hear you<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah<br>
Listen to the man listen to the man<br>
listen to the man listen to the mad man<br>
<br>
God gave you grace to purge this place<br>
And peace all around may be your fortune<br>
<br>
Oh oh children of the land<br>
Love is still the answer take my hand<br>
The vision fades a voice I hear<br>
"Listen to the madman!"<br>
<br>
But still I fear and still I dare not<br>
Laugh at the Madman
