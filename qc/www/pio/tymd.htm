<b>TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN</b><br>
<br>
Get your party gown and get your pigtail down<br>
And get your heart beatin' baby<br>
Got my timin' right I got my act all tight<br>
<br>
It's gotta be tonight<br>
My little school babe<br>
Your momma says you don't<br>
And your daddy says you won't<br>
And I'm boilin' up inside<br>
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time<br>
<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Lock your daddy out of doors<br>
I don't need him nosin' around<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Give me all your love tonight<br>
<br>
'You're such a dirty louse go get outa my house'<br>
That's all I ever get from your family ties<br>
In fact I don't think I ever heard<br>
A single little civil word from those guys<br>
I don't give a light<br>
I'm gonna make out all right<br>
I've got a sweetheart hand<br>
To put a stop to all that<br>
Snipin' and grousin'<br>
<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Take your little brother swimmin'<br>
With a brick that's all right<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Or you ain't no friend of mine<br>
<br>
Your momma and your daddy<br>
Gonna plague me till I die<br>
I can't understand it<br>
'Cause I'm a peace lovin' guy<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Get that big big big big big big<br>
Daddy out the door<br>
Tie your mother down yeah<br>
Tie your mother down<br>
Give me all your love tonight<br>
All your love tonight
