<b>WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS</b><br>
<br>
I've paid my dues<br>
Time after time<br>
I've done my sentence<br>
But committed no crime<br>
And bad mistakes<br>
I've made a few<br>
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face<br>
But I've come through<br>
<br>
We are the champions - my friends<br>
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end<br>
We are the champions<br>
We are the champions<br>
No time for losers<br>
'Cause we are the champions - of the world<br>
<br>
I've taken my bows<br>
And my curtain calls<br>
You brought me fame and fortuen and everything that goes with it<br>
I thank you all<br>
<br>
But it's been no bed of roses<br>
No pleasure cruise<br>
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race<br>
And I ain't gonna lose<br>
<br>
We are the champions - my friends<br>
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end<br>
We are the champions -<br>
We are the champions<br>
No time for losers<br>
'Cause we are the champions - of the world
