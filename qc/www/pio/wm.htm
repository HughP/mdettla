<b>WHITE MAN</b><br>
<br>
I'm a simple man with a simple name<br>
From this soil my people came<br>
In this soil remain oh yeah oh yeah<br>
He made us our shoes<br>
And we trod soft on the land<br>
But the immigrant built roads<br>
On our blood and sand oh yeah<br>
<br>
White man White man<br>
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies<br>
White man White man<br>
You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes<br>
White man White man<br>
Where you gonna hide from the hell you've made<br>
<br>
Oh the red man knows wars<br>
With his hands and his knives<br>
On the Bible you swore<br>
Fought your battle with lies oh yeah<br>
Leave my body in shame<br>
Leave my soul in disgrace<br>
But by ev'ry god's name<br>
Say a prayer for your race oh yeah<br>
<br>
White man White man<br>
Our country was green and all our rivers wide<br>
White man White man<br>
You came with a gun and soon our children died<br>
White man White man<br>
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?<br>
<br>
White man White man<br>
White man<br>
White man White man<br>
For you battled with lies<br>
White man White man<br>
Still lies<br>
White man White man<br>
Say you look around every skin and bone again<br>
<br>
What is left of your dream?<br>
Just the words on your stone<br>
A man who learned how to teach<br>
Then forgot how to learn<br>
Oh yeah
