<b>WHO NEEDS YOU?</b><br>
<br>
I make it half past six you come at seven<br>
Always try to keep me hanging round<br>
You little spoilt thing girl you kept me aiting<br>
Never contemplating my point of view<br>
This comes as no surpris<br>
I'm a fool for I believed your lies<br>
But now I've seen through your disguise<br>
Who needs well I don't need who needs you?<br>
<br>
Oh I believed you<br>
Went on my knees to you<br>
How I trusted you<br>
But you turned me down<br>
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race<br>
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face<br>
Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand<br>
Where is that helping hand?<br>
<br>
I like it I like it<br>
Well I don't need you<br>
<br>
How I was pushed around<br>
Don't let it get you down<br>
You walked all over me<br>
But don't you ever give in<br>
Taking one step forward slipping two steps back<br>
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget<br>
Reaching out for a helping hand<br>
<br>
When I met you you were always charming<br>
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine<br>
You were oh so so sophisticated<br>
Never interested in what I'd say<br>
I had to swallow my pride<br>
So naive you took me for a ride<br>
But now I'm the one to decide<br>
Who needs well I don't need who needs you?
