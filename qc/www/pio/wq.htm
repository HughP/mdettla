<b>WHITE QUEEN (AS IT BEGAN)</b><br>
<br>
So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes<br>
So sad her eyes as it began<br>
On such a breathless night as this<br>
Upon my brow the lightest kiss<br>
I walked alone<br>
And all around the air did sway<br>
May lady soon will stir this way<br>
In sorrow known<br>
The white queen walks<br>
And the night grows pale<br>
Stars of lovingness in her hair<br>
Needing unheard pleading one word<br>
So sad my eyes she cannot see<br>
<br>
How did thee fare what have thee seen<br>
The mother of the willow green<br>
I call her name<br>
And 'neath her window have I stayed<br>
I love the footsteps that she made<br>
And when see came<br>
White queen how my heart did ache<br>
And dry my lips no word would make<br>
So still I wait<br>
<br>
My goddess hear my darkest fear<br>
I speak too late<br>
It's for evermore that I wait<br>
Dear friends goodbye<br>
No tears in my eyes<br>
So sad it ends as it began
