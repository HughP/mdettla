VERSE1:
    G        (2>3)         Em           7  
In my defence      what is there to say

           C (9>8   2>1)          D     (2>3)
All the mistakes we made must be faced today


         Gadd9              Em7  
It's not easy now knowing where to start

          Cadd9                  D
While the world we love tears itself apart


CHORUS:
            G      D/F#   Em      Em7/D
I'm just a singer with a song

          Cadd9              D
How can I try to right the wrong
  
             G     B/F#    Em     G7/D
For just a singer with a melody
 
                 C    (8>9)  C/D
I'm caught in between
 
                Gadd9(>8)  Cadd9(>8)  Gadd9(>8)  Cadd9(>8)
With a fading dream


VERSE2:
In my defence what is there to say
We destroy the love - it's our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song
Love is here and then it's gone


CHORUS:

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody

               C      Cm                D
I'm caught in between    With a fading dream
