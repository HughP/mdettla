Orange Flash: A collection of flash widgets
By: Donovan Walker
License: MIT
version: 0.1.1

Overview:
In general all widgets will be designed to be plugged in and run 
without needing to have Adobe Flash. (I mean, who want's to fire up
that app every time you change something? NOT ME!) 
All configuration is done via XML files and the file url will be an 
embed variable 'configURL' or some such. Where possible, working 
examples will be included with each widget.

Hey everyone. I've started writing flash widgets as a way to learn. 
+ open source is cool and all that. :)
