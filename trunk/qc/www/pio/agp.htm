<b>All God's People</b><br>
<br>
So all you people give freely<br>
Make welcome inside your homes<br>
Thank God you people give freely<br>
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord<br>
All prime ministers and majesty around the world<br>
Open your eyes look, touch and feel<br>
Rule with your heart, live with your conscience<br>
Love, love<br>
Love, love and be free<br>
We're all God's people<br>
Gotta face up<br>
Better grow up<br>
Gotta stand tall and be strong<br>
Gotta face up<br>
Better grow up<br>
Gotta stand tall and be strong<br>
Gotta face up<br>
We're all God's people<br>
Yeah - yes there was this magic light<br>
I said to myself<br>
I'd  better go to bed and have an early night<br>
Then I, then I, then I, then I went into a dream<br>
Rule with your heart, live with your conscience<br>
We're all God's people give freely<br>
Make welcome inside your homes<br>
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible<br>
We're all God's people<br>
We're all God's people<br>
We're all God's people<br>
We're all God's people
