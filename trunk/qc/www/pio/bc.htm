<b>BACK CHAT</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
 Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
You burn all  my energy<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Criticising  all you see<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Analysing  what I say<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
And you  always get your way<br>
Oh yeah see  what yuo've done to me<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
You're  driving me insane<br>
It's a  battle to the end, knock you down you come again<br>
Talk back,  talk back you've got me on the rock<br>
Twisting  every word I say<br>
Wind me up  and get your way<br>
Fat chance I  have of making a romance<br>
If I'm every  going to win<br>
I'll have to  get the last word in<br>
Take it from  here<br>
Twisting  every word I say<br>
Wind me up  and get your way<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
You burn all  my energy<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Criticising  all you see<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Analysing  what I say<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
And you  always get your way<br>
Wake up  stand up and drag yourself on out<br>
Get down get  ready<br>
Scream and  shout<br>
Back off, be  cool<br>
And learn to  change your ways<br>
Cos you're  talking in your sleep<br>
And you are  walking in a dase<br>
Don't push  your luck<br>
I'm ready to  attack<br>
Cos when I'm  trying to talk to you<br>
All you do  is just talk back<br>
You stand so  tall, you don't frighting me at all<br>
Don't talk  back, don't talk back, don't talk back<br>
Just leave  me alone<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
You burn all  my energy<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Criticising  all you see<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
Analysing  what I say<br>
Back Chat  Back Chat<br>
And you  always get your way<br>
Yes you  do...
