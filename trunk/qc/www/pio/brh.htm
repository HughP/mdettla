<b>Bohemian Rhapsody</b> <br>
<br>
Is this the real life Is this just fantasy<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br>
A little high, little low,<br>
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,<br>
To me<br>
<br>
Mama, just killed a man,<br>
Put a gun against his head,<br>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,<br>
Mama, life had just begun,<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
Mama ooo,<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br>
<br>
Too late, my time has come,<br>
Sends shivers down my spine<br>
Body's aching all the time,<br>
Goodbye everybody-I've got to go<br>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
Mama ooo- (any way the wind blows)<br>
I don't want to die,<br>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
<br>
I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br>
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the Fandango<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning-very very frightening me<br>
Galileo, Galileo,<br>
Galileo Galileo<br>
Galileo figaro-Magnifico<br>
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
Easy come easy go-, will you let me go<br>
Bismillah! No-, we will not let you go-let him go<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go-let him go<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go-let me go<br>
Will not let you go-let me go<br>
Will not let you go let me go<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br>
<br>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br>
Oh baby-Can't do this to me baby<br>
Just gotta get out-just gotta get right outta here<br>
<br>
Nothing really matters,<br>
Anyone can see,<br>
Nothing really matters-,nothing really matters to me,<br>
<br>
Any way the wind blows....
