<b>BRIGHTON ROCK</b><br>
<br>
Happy little day<br>
Jimmy went away<br>
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday<br>
A happy pair they made so decorously laid<br>
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade<br>
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air<br>
I'll weave my spell<br>
<br>
Jenny will you stay<br>
Tarry with me pray<br>
Nothing 'ere need come between us<br>
Tell me love what do you say?<br>
Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray<br>
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday<br>
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air<br>
I'll say farewell<br>
<br>
Oh rock of ages do not crumble<br>
Love is breathing still<br>
Oh lady moon shine down<br>
A little people magic if you will<br>
<br>
Jenny pines away<br>
Writes a letter every day<br>
We must ever be together<br>
Nothing can my love erase<br>
Oh no I'm compromised<br>
I must apologize if my lady should discover<br>
How I spent my holidays
