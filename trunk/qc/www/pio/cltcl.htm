<b>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</b><br>
<br>
This thing called love I just can't handle it<br>
this thing called love I must get round to it<br>
I ain't ready<br>
Crazy little thing called love<br>
This (This Thing) called love<br>
(Called Love)<br>
It cries (Like a baby)<br>
In a cradle all night<br>
It swings (Woo Woo)<br>
It jives (Woo Woo)<br>
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,<br>
I kinda like it<br>
Crazy little thing called love<br>
<br>
There goes my baby<br>
She knows how to Rock n' roll<br>
She drives me crazy<br>
She gives me hot and cold fever<br>
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat<br>
<br>
I gotta be cool relax, get hip<br>
Get on my track's<br>
Take a back seat, hitch-hike<br>
And take a long ride on my motor bike<br>
Until I'm ready<br>
Crazy little thing called love<br>
<br>
I gotta be cool relax, get hip<br>
Get on my track's<br>
Take a back seat, hitch-hike<br>
And take a long ride on my motor bike<br>
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)<br>
Crazy little thing called love<br>
<br>
This thing called love I just can't handle it<br>
this thing called love I must get round to it<br>
I ain't ready<br>
Crazy little thing called love
