<b>DANCER</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
I'm not  invited to the party<br>
Been sitting  here all night<br>
I'm all  alone here at the party<br>
I don't feel  all right<br>
Ain't got no  black coat<br>
Ain't got no  tie<br>
I gotta  shape up now<br>
You gotta  why<br>
Dancer,  Dancer<br>
I can't live  with it I'm gonna die without it<br>
Dancer,  Dancer<br>
Ain't no  doubt about it<br>
Dancer,  Dancer<br>
Why don't  you kick off your dancing shoes<br>
And come  along with me<br>
You're the  life and soul of funk-tion<br>
It took me  all night<br>
To get hold  of the right introduction<br>
Blew me out  of sight<br>
I taste your  lipstick<br>
I look in  your eyes<br>
You feel  fantastic<br>
My body  cries<br>
(CHORUS)<br>
(HOT SPACE)<br>
Dancer,  Dancer<br>
I can't  believe your dancing<br>
Can't take  you home, can't take your dancing<br>
Dancer,  Dancer, dance the night away
