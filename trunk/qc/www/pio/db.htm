<b>Dreamer's Ball</b><br>
<br>
Oh I used to be your baby<br>
Used to be your pride and joy<br>
You used to take me dancing<br>
Just like any other boy<br>
But now you've found another partner<br>
And left me like a broken toy<br>
<br>
Oh it's someone else you're takin'<br>
Someone else you're playin' to<br>
Honey though I'm aching<br>
Know just what I have to do<br>
If I can't have you when I'm wakin'<br>
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you<br>
<br>
Oh take me take me take me<br>
To the dreamer's ball<br>
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine<br>
You're gonna love me when you see me<br>
I won't have to worry<br>
Take me take me<br>
Promise not to wake me 'till it's morning<br>
It's all been true<br>
<br>
What you say about that hey honey?<br>
You gonna take me to that dreamer's ball?<br>
I'd like that<br>
Right on down forty-second street<br>
Way down down town dreamer's town<br>
<br>
Oh take me take me take me<br>
I'm your plaything now<br>
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile<br>
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper<br>
Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby<br>
At the dreamer's ball<br>
<br>
Take me hold me<br>
Remember what you told me<br>
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball<br>
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball
