<b>Delilah</b><br>
<br>
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible<br>
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry<br>
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - when I like it<br>
You get away with murder, so innocent<br>
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite -<br>
That's alright !<br>
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable<br>
You make me so very happy<br>
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me<br>
And then you make me slightly mad<br>
When you pee all over my Chippendale Suite<br>
Delilah, Delilah,<br>
Hey - Hey - Hey,<br>
You take over my house and home<br>
You even try to answer my telephone<br>
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes<br>
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,<br>
Delilah - I love you<br>
Delilah - Oh you make me so very happy - you give me kisses<br>
And I go out of my mind ooh,<br>
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,<br>
You're irresistible - I love you Delilah<br>
Delilah - I love you<br>
Oooh - I love you<br>
Oooh - I love your kisses<br>
Oooh - I love your kisses ...
