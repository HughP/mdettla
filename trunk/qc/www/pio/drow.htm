<b>DROWSE</b><br>
<br>
It's the sad eyed goodbye<br>
Yesterday's moments I remember<br>
It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall<br>
It's the mistier mists the hazier days<br>
The brighter sun and the easier lays<br>
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying<br>
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all<br>
<br>
It's the fantastic drowse<br>
Of the afternoon Sundays<br>
That bored you to rages of tears<br>
The unending pleadings<br>
To waste all your good times<br>
In thoughts of your middle-aged years<br>
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told<br>
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero<br>
And there's all the more reason<br>
For living or dying when you're young<br>
And your troubles are all very small<br>
<br>
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet<br>
And scuff up the sidewalk<br>
With endlessly restless feet<br>
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds<br>
More in the pool hall<br>
Than we did in the school hall<br>
With the down town chewing gum bums<br>
Watching the night life the lights and the fun<br>
<br>
Never wanted to be the boy next door<br>
Always thought I'd be something more<br>
But it ain't easy for a small town boy<br>
It ain't easy at all<br>
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong<br>
It's easier from an arm chair<br>
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness<br>
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess<br>
<br>
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood<br>
Jimi Hendrix he was good<br>
Let's try William the Conqueror<br>
Now who else do I like?
