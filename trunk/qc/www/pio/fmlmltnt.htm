<b>LOVE ME LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW</b><br>
<br>
You had to kill the conversation<br>
You always had the upper hand<br>
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand<br>
You had to go and ruin all our plans<br>
Packed your bags and you're leaving home<br>
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go<br>
But we have one more day together so<br>
<br>
Love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it<br>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over<br>
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
<br>
I guess we drift alone in separate ways<br>
I don't have all that far to go<br>
God knows I've learned to play the lonely man<br>
I've never felt so low in all my life<br>
We were born to be just losers<br>
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go<br>
But we only have one more day together so<br>
<br>
Love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it<br>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over<br>
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
<br>
Tomorrow God knows just where I'll be<br>
Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me<br>
Anything can happen but we only have one more day together<br>
Just one more day forever so<br>
<br>
Love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it<br>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over<br>
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
<br>
Love me like there's no tomorrow<br>
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it<br>
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over<br>
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
