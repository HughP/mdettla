<b>FLICK OF THE WRIST</b><br>
<br>
Dislocate your spine if you don't sign<br>
He says I'll have you seeing double<br>
Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied<br>
Simply with those eyes ooh<br>
Synchronize your minds and see<br>
The beast within him rise<br>
Don't look back don't look back<br>
It's a rip off<br>
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby<br>
Blow him a kiss and you're mad<br>
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out<br>
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head<br>
He's taken an arm and taken a leg<br>
All this time honey baby you've been had<br>
<br>
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm sayin'<br>
If not you'll lie in knee deep trouble<br>
Prostitute yourself he says<br>
Castrate your human pride ooh<br>
Sacrifice your leisure days<br>
Let me squeeze you 'till you've dried<br>
Don't look back don't look back<br>
It's a rip off<br>
<br>
Work my fingers to my bones<br>
I scream with pain I still make no impression<br>
Seduce you with his money make machine<br>
Cross collateralise big time money money<br>
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine<br>
Then the last goodbye<br>
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby<br>
Blow him a kiss and you're mad<br>
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out<br>
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head<br>
He's taken an arm and taken a leg<br>
All this time honey baby you've been had
