<b>GOOD COMPANY</b><br>
<br>
Take good care of what you've got<br>
My father said to me<br>
As he puffed his pipe and baby B<br>
He dandled on his knee<br>
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away<br>
Keep all good company oohoo oohoo<br>
Take care of those you call your own and keep good company<br>
<br>
Soon I grew and happy too<br>
My very good friends and me<br>
We'd play all day with Sally J<br>
The girl from number four<br>
And very soon I begged her<br>
Won't you keep me company?<br>
Oohoo oohoo oohoo oohoo<br>
Come marry me for evermore<br>
We'll be good company<br>
<br>
Now marriage is an institution sure<br>
My wife and I our needs and nothing more<br>
All my friends by a year by and by disappeared<br>
But we're safe enough behind our door<br>
<br>
I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew<br>
The work devoured my waking hours but when my time was through<br>
Reward of all my efforts<br>
My own Limited Company<br>
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company<br>
All through the years in the end it appears<br>
There was never really anyone but me<br>
Now I'm old I puff my pipe but no one's there to see<br>
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity<br>
Take care of those you call your own<br>
And keep good company
