<b>GOOD OLD FASHIONED LOVER BOY</b><br>
<br>
I can dim the lights<br>
And sing you songs full of sad things<br>
We can do the tango just for two<br>
I can serenade and gently play<br>
On your heart strings<br>
Be your Valentino just for you<br>
<br>
Ooh love Ooh lover boy<br>
What're doing tonight hey boy?<br>
Set my alarm turn on my charm<br>
That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy<br>
<br>
Ooh let me feel you heartbeat<br>
(Grow faster faster)<br>
Ooh can you feel my love heat<br>
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love<br>
And tell me how do you feel right after all<br>
I'd like for you and I to go romancing<br>
Say the word your wish is my command<br>
<br>
Ooh love Ooh lover boy<br>
What're doing tonight hey boy?<br>
Write my letter feel much better<br>
And use my fancy patter on the telephone<br>
<br>
When I'm not with you<br>
Think of you always I miss you<br>
(I miss those long hot summer nights)<br>
When I'm not with you<br>
Think of me always I love you love you<br>
Hey boy where did you get it from?<br>
Hey boy where did you go?<br>
I learned my passion<br>
In the good old fashioned school of lover boys<br>
<br>
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely<br>
(One two three four five six seven eight nine)<br>
I will pay the bill you taste the wine<br>
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely<br>
Just take me back to yours that will be fine<br>
(Come on and get it)<br>
Ooh love Ooh lover boy<br>
What're you doing tonight hey boy?<br>
Ev'rything's all right just hold on tight<br>
That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy
