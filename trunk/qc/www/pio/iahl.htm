<b>It's A Hard Life</b><br>
(Freddie Mercury)<br>
<br>
I don't want  my freedom<br>
There's no  reason for living with a broken heart.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is a  tricky situation -<br>
I've only  got myself to blame<br>
It's just a  simple fact of life<br>
It can  happen to anyone -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You win -  you lose<br>
It,s a  chance you have to take with love<br>
Oh yeah - I  fell in love<br>
But now you  say it's over and I'm falling apart.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It's a hard  life<br>
To be true  lovers together<br>
To love and  live forever in each others hearts -<br>
It's a long  hard fight<br>
To learn to  care for each other<br>
To trust in  one another right from the start<br>
When you're  in love -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I try and  mend the broken pieces<br>
I try to  fight back the tears<br>
They say  it's just a state of mind<br>
But it  happens to everyone -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now it hurts  - deep inside<br>
When your  love has cut you down to size<br>
Life is  tough - on your own<br>
Now I'm  waiting for something to fall from the skies<br>
Waiting for  love.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yes it's a  hard life<br>
Two lovers  together<br>
To love and  live forever in each others hearts<br>
It's a long  hard fight<br>
To learn to  care for each other<br>
To trust in  one another - right from the start<br>
When you're  in love -<br>
Yes it's a  hard life<br>
In a world  that's filled with sorrow<br>
There are  people searching for love in every way -<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It's a long  hard fight -<br>
But I'll  always live for tomorrow<br>
I'll look  back on myself and say I did it for love<br>
Yes I did it  for love - for love - oh I did it for love.
