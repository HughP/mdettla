I'm Going Slightly Mad<br>
<br>
When the outside temperature rises<br>
And the meaning is oh so clear<br>
One thousand and one yellow daffodils<br>
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear<br>
Are they trying to tell you something<br>
You're missing that one final screw<br>
You're simply not in the pink my dear<br>
To be honest you haven't got a clue<br>
<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
It finally happened - happened<br>
It finally happened - ooh oh<br>
It finally happened<br>
I'm slightly mad<br>
Oh dear<br>
<br>
I'm one card short of a full deck<br>
I'm not quite the shilling<br>
One wave short of a shipwreck<br>
I'm not my usual top billing<br>
I'm coming down with a fever<br>
I'm really out to sea<br>
This kettle is boiling over<br>
I think I'm a banana tree<br>
Oh dear<br>
<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
It finally happened - happened<br>
It finally happened - uh huh<br>
It finally happened<br>
I'm slightly mad<br>
Oh dear<br>
<br>
Ooh ooh ah ah<br>
Ooh ooh ah ah<br>
I'm knitting with only one needle<br>
Unravelling fast it's true<br>
I'm driving only three wheels these days<br>
But my dear how about you<br>
<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
I'm going slightly mad<br>
It finally happened<br>
It finally happened - oh yes<br>
It finally happened<br>
I'm slightly mad<br>
Just very slightly mad<br>
<br>
And there you have it
