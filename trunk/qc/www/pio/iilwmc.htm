<b>I'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR</b><br>
<br>
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine,<br>
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam.<br>
When I'm holding your wheel,<br>
All I hear is your gear,<br>
When my hand's on your grease gun,<br>
Oh it's like a disease son,<br>
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,<br>
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar,<br>
Such a thrill when your radials squeal.<br>
<br>
Told my girl I just had to forget her,<br>
Rather buy me a new cartburettor,<br>
So she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,<br>
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now,<br>
<br>
When I'm holding your wheel,<br>
All I hear is your gear,<br>
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive,<br>
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive,<br>
<br>
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,<br>
I'm in love with my car, string back gloves in my automolove!
