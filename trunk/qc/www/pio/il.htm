<b>IT'S LATE</b><br>
<br>
You say you love me<br>
And I hardly know your name<br>
And if I say I love you in the candle light<br>
There's no one but myself to blame<br>
But there's something inside<br>
That's turning my mind away<br>
Oh how I could love you<br>
If I could let you stay<br>
<br>
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside<br>
It's late - is it just my sickly pride<br>
Too late - even now the feeling seems to slip away<br>
<br>
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say<br>
It's late It's late It's late<br>
But not too late<br>
<br>
The way you love me<br>
Is the sweetest love around<br>
But after all this time<br>
The more I'm tryin<br>
The more I seem to let you down<br>
Now you tell me you're leaving<br>
And I just can't believe it's tru<br>
Oh you know that I can love you<br>
Though you know I can't be true
