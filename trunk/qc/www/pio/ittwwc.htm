<b>Is This The World We Created...?</b> (Freddie Mercury)<br>
<br>
Just think  of all those hungry mouths we have to feed<br>
Take a look  at all the suffering we breed<br>
So many  lonely faces scattered all around<br>
Searching  for what they need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Is this the  world we created<br>
What did me  do it for<br>
Is this the  world we invaded<br>
Against me  law<br>
So it seems  in the end<br>
Is this what  we're all living for today<br>
The world  that we created.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You know  that everyday a helpless child is born<br>
Who needs  some loving care inside a happy home<br>
Somewhere a  wealthy man is sitting on his throne<br>
Waiting for  life to go by.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Is this the  world we created, we made it on our own<br>
Is this the  world we devastated, right to the bone<br>
If there's a  God in the sky looking down<br>
What can he  think of what we've done<br>
To the world  that He created.
