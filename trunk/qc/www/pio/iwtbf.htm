<b>I Want To Break Free</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
I want to  break free<br>
I want to  break free<br>
I want to  break free from your lies<br>
You're so  self satisfied I don't need you<br>
I've got to  break free<br>
God knows,  God knows I want to break free.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I've fallen  in love<br>
I've fallen  in love for the first time<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And this  time I know it's for real<br>
I've fallen  in love, yeah<br>
God knows,  God knows I've fallen in love.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It's strange  but it's true<br>
I can't get  over the way you love me like you do<br>
But I have  to be sure<br>
When I walk  out that door<br>
Oh how I  want to be free, baby<br>
Oh how I  want to be free,<br>
Oh how I  want to break free.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But life  still goes on<br>
I can't get  used to, living without, living without,<br>
Living  without you by my side<br>
I don't want  to live alone, hey<br>
God knows,  got to make it on my own<br>
So baby  can't you see<br>
I've got to  break free.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I've got to  break free.<br>
I want to  break free, yeah<br>
I want, I  want, I want, I want to break free.
