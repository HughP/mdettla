<b>Jealousy</b><br>
<br>
Oh how wrong can you be?<br>
Oh to fall in love<br>
Was my very first mistake<br>
How was I to know<br>
I was far too much in love too see?<br>
Oh jealousy look at me now<br>
Jealousy you got me somehow<br>
You gave me no warning<br>
Took me by surprise<br>
Jealousy you led me on<br>
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail<br>
You had suspicion on my trail<br>
How how how all my jealousy<br>
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride<br>
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy<br>
<br>
Oh how strong can you be<br>
With matters of the heart?<br>
Life is much too short<br>
To while away with tears<br>
If only you could see<br>
Just what you do to me<br>
Oh jealousy you tripped me up<br>
Jealousy you brought me down<br>
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain<br>
Jealousy when will you let go?<br>
Gotta hold of my possessive mind<br>
Turned me into a jealous guy<br>
<br>
How how how all my jealousy<br>
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride<br>
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy<br>
But now it matters not<br>
If I should live or die<br>
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy
