<b>KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE</b><br>
<br>
I was told a million times<br>
Of all the troubles in my way<br>
Tried to grow a little wiser<br>
Little better ev'ry day<br>
But if I crossed a million rivers<br>
And I rode a million miles<br>
Then I'd still be where I started<br>
Bread and butter for a smile<br>
Well I sold a million mirrors<br>
In a shop in Alley Way<br>
But I never saw my face<br>
In any window any day<br>
Well they say your folks are telling you<br>
To be a super star<br>
But I tell you just be satisfied<br>
To stay right where you are<br>
<br>
Keep yourself alivey yeah keep yourself alive<br>
lt'll take you all your time and a money<br>
Honey you'll survive<br>
<br>
Well I've loved a million women<br>
In a belladonic haze<br>
And I ate a million dinners<br>
Brought to me on silver trays<br>
Give me ev'rything I need<br>
To feed my body and my soul<br>
And I'll grow a little bigger<br>
Maybe that can be my goal<br>
I was told a million times<br>
Of all the people in my way<br>
How I had to keep on trying<br>
And get better ev'ry day<br>
But if I crossed a million rivers<br>
And I rode a million miles<br>
Then I'd still be where<br>
I started<br>
Still be where<br>
I started<br>
Keep younelf alive c'mon keep yourself alive<br>
lt'll take you all your time and a money<br>
Honey you'll survive<br>
<br>
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive<br>
lt'll take you all your time  and money<br>
To keep me satisfied<br>
Do you think you're better ev'ry day<br>
No I just think I'm two steps<br>
Nearer to my grave<br>
Keep yourself alive c'mon keep yourself alive<br>
You take your time and take my money<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
<br>
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive<br>
All you people keep yourself alive<br>
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive<br>
lt'll take you all your time and a money<br>
To keep me satisfied<br>
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive<br>
All you people keep yourself alive<br>
<br>
Take you all your time and money honey<br>
You will survive<br>
<br>
Keep you satisfied keep you satisfied
