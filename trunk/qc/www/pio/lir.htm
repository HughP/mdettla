<b>LIFE IS REAL (SONG FOR LENNON)</b><br>
(Freddie Mercury)<br>
<br>
Guilt stains  on my pillow<br>
Blood on my  terraces<br>
Torsos in my  closet<br>
Shadows from  my past life is real<br>
Life is  real, life is real, so real<br>
Sleeping is  my leisure<br>
Waking up in  a minefield<br>
Dream is  just a pleasure dome<br>
Love is a  roulette wheel - life is real<br>
Life is  real, life is real, oh yeah<br>
Success is  my breathing space<br>
I brought it  on myself<br>
I will price  it<br>
I will cash  it<br>
I can take  it or leave it<br>
Loneliness  is my hiding place<br>
Breastfeeding myself<br>
What more  can I say<br>
I swallowed  the bitter pill<br>
I can taste  it, I can taste it<br>
Life is  real, life is real, life is real<br>
Music will  be my mistress<br>
Loving like  a whore<br>
Lennon is a  genius<br>
Living in  every pore<br>
Life is  real, life is real, life is real, so real<br>
Life is  cruel<br>
Life is a  bitch<br>
Life is real  - so real
