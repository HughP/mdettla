Hey - let me welcome you ladies and gentlemen<br>

Are you ready for some entertainment?<br>

With a little bit of style<br>
C'mon let me entertain you let me entertain you<br>

I'll Cruela-de-ville you<br>
And to thrill you I'll use any device<br>

We'll give you crazy performance<br>
We'll give you grounds for divorce<br>
We'll give you piece de resistance<br>
And a tour de force of course<br>
<br>
We found the right location<br>
Got a lot of pretty lights<br>

If you want to see some action<br>
You get nothing but the best<br>
The S and M attraction<br>
We've got the pleasure chest<br>

We get you on the line<br>
If you dig the New York scene<br>
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time<br>
C'mon<br>
