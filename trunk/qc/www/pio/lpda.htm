<b>LAS PALABRAS DE AMOR</b> (THE WORDS OF LOVE)<br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
Don't touch  me now<br>
Don't hold  me now<br>
Don't break  the spell Darling, now you are near<br>
Look in my  eyes<br>
And speak to  me<br>
The special  promises I want to hear<br>
Las palabras  de amor<br>
Let me hear  words of love<br>
Despacito mi  amor<br>
Love me slow  and gently<br>
One foolish  world, so many souls<br>
Senselessly  hurled through the never ending cold<br>
And all for  fear, and all for greed<br>
Speak any  tongue but for God's sake we need<br>
Las palabras  de amor<br>
Let me hear  words of love<br>
Despacito mi  amor<br>
Let me know,  this night and evermore<br>
This room is  bare<br>
This night  is cold<br>
We're far  apart and I'm growing old<br>
But while we  live, we'll meet again<br>
So then my  love we may whisper once more<br>
It's you I  adore<br>
Las palabras  de amor<br>
Let me hear  words of love<br>
Despacito mi  amor<br>
Touch me now<br>
Las palabras  de amor<br>
Let us share  the words of love<br>
For evermore<br>
For evermore
