<b>Machines</b> (or 'Back To Humans')<br>
Roger Taylor)<br>
<br>
It's a  Machine's world<br>
Don't tell  me I ain't go a soul<br>
When the  machines take over<br>
It ain't no  place for you and me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
They tell me  don't care<br>
But deep  inside I'm just a man<br>
They freeze  me they burn me<br>
They squeeze  me they stress me<br>
With  smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me<br>
But no-one,  but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away<br>
Back to  Humans.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;We have no  disease, no trouble of mind<br>
&quot;We're  fighting for peace, no regard for the time<br>
&quot;We never  cry, we never retreat<br>
&quot;We have no  conception of love of defeat.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What's tahat  the Machine noise<br>
It's bytes  and megachips for tea<br>
It's that  Machine, boys<br>
With Random  Access Memory<br>
Never worry,  never mind<br>
Not for  money, not for gold.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It's  software it's hardware<br>
It's  heartbeat is time-share<br>
It's  midwife's a disk drive<br>
It's a  sex-life is quantised<br>
It's  self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Back to  Humans<br>
Back to  Humans.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Back to  Machines.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Living in a  new world<br>
Thinking in  the past<br>
Living in a  new world<br>
How you  gonna last<br>
Machine  world... it's a Machine's world...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Change.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Back to  Humans.
