<b>MY MELANCHOLY BLUES</b><br>
<br>
Another party's over<br>
And I'm left cold sober<br>
My baby left me for somebody new<br>
I don't wanna talk about it<br>
Want to forget about it<br>
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew<br>
So come and get me<br>
Let me<br>
Get in that sinking feeling<br>
That says my heart is on an all time low - So<br>
Don't expect me<br>
To behave perfectly<br>
And wear that sunny smile<br>
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast<br>
Don't try and stop me<br>
'Cos I'm heading for that stormy weather soon<br>
<br>
I'm causing a mild<br>
With this new occupation<br>
I'm permanently glued<br>
To this extraordinary mood so now move over<br>
Let me take over<br>
With my melancholy blues<br>
<br>
I'm causing a mild sensation<br>
With this new occupation<br>
I'm in the news<br>
I'm just getting used to my new exposure<br>
So come into my enclosure<br>
And meet my<br>
Melancholy blues
