MARCH OF THE BLACK QUEEN <br>
<br>
Do you mean it do you mean it do you mean it<br>
Why don't you mean it why do I follow you<br>
And where do you go?<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah<br>
You've never seen nothing like it<br>
No never in your life<br>
Like going up to heaven<br>
And then coming back alive<br>
Let me tell you all about it<br>
Oooh give me a little time to choose<br>
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight<br>
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night<br>
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile<br>
Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file<br>
Take this take that bring them down to size<br>
March to the Black Queen<br>
<br>
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys<br>
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil<br>
Black on black on every finger nail and toe<br>
We've only begun - begun<br>
Make this make that keep making all that noise<br>
Ooh march to the Black Queen<br>
Now I've got a belly full<br>
You can be my sugar baby<br>
You can be my honey chile<br>
<br>
A voice from behind me reminds me<br>
Spread out your wings you are an angel<br>
Remember to deliver with the speed of light<br>
A little bit of love and joy<br>
Everything you do bears a will<br>
And a why and a wherefore<br>
A little bit of love and joy<br>
In each and every soul lies a man<br>
And very soon he'll deceive and discover<br>
But even to the end of his life<br>
He'll bring a little love<br>
<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah<br>
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right<br>
I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night<br>
I've got the power now to do<br>
The march of the Black Queen<br>
My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie<br>
I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like<br>
I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy<br>
I'll do the march of the Black Queen<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah<br>
<br>
Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile<br>
The Black Queen tattoos all her pies<br>
She boils and she bakes<br>
And she never dots her I's<br>
La la la la la la la la la la la la<br>
La la la la la<br>
<br>
Forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies<br>
Surrender to the city of the fireflies<br>
Dance to the devil in beat with the band<br>
To hell with all of you hand in hand<br>
But now it's time to be gone<br>
La la la la forever forever<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah
