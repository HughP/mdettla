<b>More Of That Jazz</b><br>
<br>
If you're feelin' tired and lonely<br>
Uninspired and lonely<br>
If you're thinkin' how the days seem long<br>
All you're given<br>
Is what you've been given<br>
A thousand times before<br>
Just more more<br>
More of that jazz<br>
More no more of that jazz<br>
Give me no more<br>
No more of that jazz<br>
<br>
Only football gives us thrills<br>
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills<br>
Only our team is the real team<br>
Bring out the dogs get on your feet<br>
Lay on the floor<br>
Can't help thinkin' I've heard that line before<br>
Just more more<br>
More of that jazz<br>
More no more of that jazz<br>
Give me no more<br>
No more of that jazz<br>
<br>
Oh no matter<br>
Fool got no business hanging round and tellin' lies<br>
Bicycle races are coming your way<br>
If you can't beat 'em join them<br>
Fun it<br>
Oh you're gonna let it all hang out<br>
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round<br>
<br>
No more no more no more<br>
Of that jazz
