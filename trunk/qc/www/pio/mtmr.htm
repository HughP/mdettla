<b>MODERN TIMES ROCK'N' ROLL</b><br>
<br>
Had to make do with<br>
A worn out rock and roll scene<br>
The old hop is gettin' tired need a rest<br>
Well you know what I mean<br>
Fifty eight that was great<br>
But it's over now and That's all<br>
Somethin' harder's coming up<br>
Gonna really knock<br>
A hole in the wall<br>
Gonna hit ya<br>
Grab you hard<br>
Make you feel<br>
Ten feet tall<br>
<br>
Well I hope<br>
This baby's gonna come along soon<br>
You don't know<br>
It could happen any til' rainy<br>
Afternoon<br>
With the temperature down<br>
And the juke box blowin'<br>
no fuse<br>
And my musical life's feelin'<br>
Like a long Sunday School cruise<br>
And you know there's one thing<br>
Every single body could use<br>
Yeah listen to me baby<br>
Let me tell you what it's all about<br>
Modern times rock and roll<br>
Modern times rock and roll<br>
<br>
Get you high heeled guitar boots<br>
And some groovy clothes<br>
Get a hair piece on your chest<br>
And a ring through your nose<br>
Find a nice little man<br>
Who says<br>
He's gonna make you<br>
A real big star<br>
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants<br>
Think you should go far<br>
Everybody in this bum sucking world<br>
Gonna know just who you are<br>
Look out<br>
Modern times rock and roll
