<b>NEVERMORE</b><br>
<br>
There's no living in my life anymore<br>
The seas have gone dry<br>
And the rain's stopped falling<br>
Please don't you cry anymore<br>
Can't you see<br>
Listen to the breeze<br>
And whisper to me please<br>
Don't seed me to the path of nevermore<br>
<br>
Even in the valley's down below<br>
Where the rays of the sun<br>
Were so warm and tender<br>
Now haven't anything to grow<br>
Can't you see?<br>
Why did you have to leave me?<br>
Why did you deceive me?<br>
You sent me to the path of nevermore<br>
When you say you didn't love me anymore<br>
Ah ah nevermore nevermore
