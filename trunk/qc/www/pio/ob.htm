<b>OGRE BATTLE</b><br>
<br>
Now once upon a time<br>
An old man told me a fable<br>
When the piper is gone<br>
And the soup is cold upon the table<br>
And if the black crow flies<br>
To find a new destinatio<br>
That is the sign<br>
<br>
Come tonight<br>
Come to the ogre site<br>
Come to ogre battle fight<br>
<br>
He gives a great big cry<br>
And he can swallow up the ocean<br>
With mighty tongue he catches flies<br>
And the palm of his hand incredible size<br>
One great big eye<br>
Has to focus in your direction<br>
Now the battle is on<br>
Yeah yeah yeah<br>
<br>
Come tonight<br>
Come to the ogre site<br>
Come to ogre battle fight<br>
<br>
Ah ah ah ah ah<br>
The ogre en are still inside<br>
The two way mirror mountain<br>
You gotta keep down<br>
Right out of site<br>
You can't see in but they can see out<br>
Keep a look out<br>
The ogre men are comming out<br>
From the two way mirror mountain<br>
They're running up behind<br>
And they're comming all about<br>
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south<br>
<br>
Ogre men are going home<br>
The great big fight is over<br>
Bugle blow that trumpet cry<br>
Ogre Battle lives for ever more<br>
You can come along<br>
You can come along<br>
Come to ogre battle
