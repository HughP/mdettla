<b>One Year Of Love</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
Just one year  of love<br>
Is better than a lifetime alone,<br>
One sentimental moment in your arms<br>
Is like a shooting star right through my heart.<br>
It's always a rainy day without you,<br>
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -<br>
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.<br>
My heart cries out to your heart,<br>
I'm lonely but you can save me,<br>
My hand reaches out for your hand,<br>
I'm cold but you light the fire in me,<br>
My lips search for your lips,<br>
I'm hungry for your touch,<br>
There' so much left unspoken<br>
And all I can do is surrender<br>
To the moment just surrender,<br>
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much,<br>
Ooh yes it hurts,<br>
And pain is so close to pleasure,<br>
And all I can do is surrender to your love,<br>
Just surrender to your love.<br>
Just one year of love<br>
Is better than a lifetime alone,<br>
One sentimental moment in your arms<br>
Is like a shooting star right through my heart.<br>
It's always a rainy day without you,<br>
I'm a prisoner of love inside you,<br>
I'm falling apart all around you,<br>
And all I can do is surrender.
