<b>Pain Is So Close To Pleasure</b><br>
(John Deacon)<br>
<br>
Ooh, ooh, pain  is so close to pleasure, oh yeah,<br>
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,<br>
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows,<br>
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time,<br>
When I was young and just getting started,<br>
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted,<br>
Then I grew up and got my imagination<br>
And all I wanted was to start a new relation,<br>
I was looking for some good old satisfaction,<br>
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection,<br>
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,<br>
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,<br>
Pain and pleasure. Ooh, Ooh, pain and pleasure,<br>
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,<br>
But inside of yout mind you have to put up a fight,<br>
Where are the answers that we're all searching for,<br>
There's nothing is this world to be sure of anymore,<br>
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad,<br>
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad,<br>
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face,<br>
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years,<br>
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so,<br>
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,<br>
Pain and pleasure ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,<br>
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,<br>
All your life.<br>
Pain - pleasure...
