<b>PUT OUT THE FIRE</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
They called  him a hero<br>
In the land  of the free<br>
But he won't  shake my hand boy<br>
He  disappointed me<br>
So I got my  handgun<br>
And I blew  him away<br>
That critter  was a bad guy<br>
I had to  make him pay<br>
You might  fear for my reason<br>
I don't care  what they say<br>
Look out  baby it's the season<br>
For the mad  masquerade<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
You need a  bullet like a hole in the head<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
Don't  believe what your granddaddy said<br>
She was my  lover<br>
It was a  shame that she died<br>
But  constitution's right on my side<br>
Cos I caught  my lover in neighbour's bed<br>
I got  retribution, filled 'em full of lead<br>
I've been  told it's the fashion<br>
To let me on  the streets again<br>
It's nothing  but a crime of passion<br>
And I'm not  to blame<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
You need a  weapon like a hole in the head<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
And let your  sons and your daughters<br>
Sleep sound  in their beds<br>
You know a  gun never killed nobody<br>
You can ask  anyone<br>
People get  shot by people<br>
People with  guns<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
You need a  gun like a hole in the head<br>
Put out the  fire<br>
Just tell me  that old fashioned gun law___<br>
&nbsp; is dead
