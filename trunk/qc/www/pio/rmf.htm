<b>RAIN MUST FALL</b> <br>
<br>
I can see it in your stars<br>
Life is so exciting<br>
Acting so bizzare<br>
Your world is so inviting<br>
Playing really cool<br>
And looking so mysterious honey<br>
Your every day is full of sunshine<br>
But into every life a little rain must fall<br>
<br>
No problem<br>
Uh<br>
Be cool now<br>
<br>
Anyone who imagines<br>
They can blind you with science<br>
Bully you all over<br>
With property and finance<br>
But you have the position<br>
To call the shots and name the price honey<br>
You found success and recognition<br>
But into every life a little rain must fall<br>
<br>
Flo Jo<br>
<br>
You lead a fairy tale existance<br>
But into every life a little rain must fall<br>
<br>
Be cool<br>
Hah<br>
Kiss kiss<br>
<br>
Others seem to think<br>
You are over dramatising<br>
Problems at work<br>
So it's hardly suprising<br>
There's little you can do<br>
To alter their opinions honey<br>
You want a clean reputation<br>
But now you're facing complications<br>
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall<br>
<br>
Be cool<br>
Get serious<br>
Alright<br>
Play it nice and cool<br>
<br>
Play it nice and cool<br>
That's good<br>
One more time<br>
Aha<br>
I like it
