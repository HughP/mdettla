<b>ABANDON FIRE</b><br>
<br>
Join our army join our band<br>
Join our army and be a real man<br>
<br>
Abandon hope who enter here<br>
Land of hopelessness and fear<br>
A band of gypsies a band of gold<br>
Won't save your hide won't save your soul<br>
Caught like a fly on the face of the Eiger<br>
There's a smile on the face of the tiger<br>
Abandon hope<br>
(Is this your answer?)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon ship<br>
(You know the answer)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
<br>
Join our army join our band<br>
Join our army and be a real man<br>
<br>
The fires of hell would feel ice cold<br>
And sure as time you'll soon grow old<br>
Tears of heartache tears of rage<br>
From living in a tiring age<br>
Caught like a fly on the face of the Eiger<br>
Now there's a smile on the face of the tiger<br>
Abandon hope<br>
(Is this your answer?)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon ship<br>
(This is no answer)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon hope<br>
(You know the answer)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon ship<br>
Abandon fire<br>
<br>
Listen to the rhythms of the city life<br>
Listen to the rhythms of your soul<br>
Listen to the rustling in the undergrowth<br>
Follow in the footsteps to your goal<br>
<br>
Abandon hope<br>
(Is this your answer?)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon ship<br>
(This is no answer)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon hope<br>
(You know the answer)<br>
Abandon fire<br>
Abandon ship<br>
Abandon fire
