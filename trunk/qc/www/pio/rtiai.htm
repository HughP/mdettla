<b>IT'S AN ILLUSION</b><br>
<br>
Can't believe what you hear<br>
Don't believe what you read<br>
Hard to see what you need these days<br>
Can't believe that it's true<br>
You know we had so much to do<br>
How come you treat me this way<br>
<br>
Hey - you<br>
Why don't you play by the rules<br>
Play by the rules<br>
You - just<br>
You must take me<br>
Take me for some kind of fool<br>
<br>
It's an illusion<br>
Here and gone in a day<br>
Not what it seems this American dream<br>
Just drifting away<br>
It's an illusion<br>
After all that we've seen<br>
A complete waste of time<br>
Just a nursery rhyme<br>
Can't believe that you're leaving<br>
<br>
Can't believe what you hear<br>
Don't believe what you read<br>
Hard to see what you need these days<br>
They'll feed you the facts<br>
Leave you like a kid on a railroad track<br>
Our reason is fading away<br>
<br>
O.K.<br>
Not much left I can do<br>
I can do<br>
You - just<br>
You just took me<br>
Took me for some kinda fool<br>
<br>
It's an illusion<br>
Here and gone in a day<br>
Not what it seems this American dream<br>
Just drifting away<br>
It's an illusion<br>
After all that we've seen<br>
It's a complete waste of time<br>
Just a nursery rhyme<br>
Can't believe that you're leaving<br>
<br>
It's an illusion - it's an illusion<br>
It's an illusion<br>
It's an illusion
