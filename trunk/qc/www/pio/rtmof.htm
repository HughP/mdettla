<b>MAN ON FIRE</b><br>
<br>
I walk these streets each and every day<br>
Trying to find some work just to earn my pay<br>
Just to make some plans for you some day<br>
But plans don't work and it's not that fine<br>
When you've got no money all you've got is time<br>
Don't it make you stop and wonder why<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed<br>
Sometimes I wanna burn down this crazy town<br>
<br>
I walk these streets each and every night<br>
Feel I'm playing my role but it fits too tight<br>
Watch my life go by in black and white<br>
When times are hard and times are rough<br>
Then you better be made of sterner stuff<br>
You'll find it's time to stop and wonder why<br>
<br>
I'm smokin' - I'm burnin'<br>
I'm twisting and turning<br>
But one thing I'm learning<br>
It's the power of your love keeps me under their thumb<br>
'Cos the beat of your heart is the beat of my drum<br>
Don't it make you stop and wonder why<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed<br>
Sometimes I wanna burn down this crazy town<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed<br>
Sometimes I wanna burn down this crazy town<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed<br>
Sometimes I wanna burn down this crazy town<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire<br>
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed<br>
I wanna burn down this crazy town
