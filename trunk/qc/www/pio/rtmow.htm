<b>MASTERS OF WAR</b><br>
<br>
Come you masters of war<br>
You that build the big guns<br>
You that build the death planes<br>
You that build all the bombs<br>
You that hide behind walls<br>
You that hide behind desks<br>
I just want you to know I can see through your masks<br>
<br>
Like Judas of old<br>
You lie and deceive<br>
A world war can be won<br>
You want me to believe<br>
But I see through your eyes<br>
And I see through your brain<br>
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain<br>
<br>
You fasten all the triggers<br>
For the others to fire<br>
Then you sit back and watch<br>
While the death count gets higher<br>
You hide in your mansion<br>
While the young people's blood<br>
Flows out of their bodies and into the mud<br>
<br>
You've thrown the worst fear<br>
That can ever be hurled<br>
Fear to bring children<br>
Into the world<br>
For threatening my baby<br>
Unborn and unnamed<br>
You're not worth the blood that runs in your veins<br>
<br>
And I hope that you die<br>
And your death will come soon<br>
I'll follow your casket<br>
On a pale afternoon<br>
And I'll watch while you're lowered<br>
Down to your deathbed<br>
I'll stand over your grave<br>
Till I'm sure that you're dead
