<b>STRANGE FRONTIER</b><br>
<br>
Strange frontier...<br>
<br>
Into the shadows<br>
From out of the light<br>
Into the darkness<br>
And into the night<br>
We're off the tracks<br>
We're off the lines<br>
You and me seen better times<br>
Now we're on the borderline and I wish I wasn't here<br>
People say it could never happen here<br>
But this is a strange frontier<br>
<br>
Freedom fighters come and go<br>
Bloody, righteous - and mentally slow<br>
We're on the skids<br>
We're off the lines<br>
Trapped inside these dangerous times<br>
Now we've reached the borderline you can start to smell the fear<br>
People say it could never happen here<br>
But this is a strange frontier<br>
<br>
Had some good times<br>
Had some fun<br>
Soon our problems<br>
Could be none<br>
We're on the skids<br>
We're off the lines<br>
We're out of luck<br>
We're out of time<br>
Now we're on the borderline we've nearly gone and done it this time<br>
People say it could never happen here<br>
But this is a strange frontier<br>
<br>
Freedom fighters come and go<br>
Bloody, righteous - and mentally slow<br>
We're out of work<br>
We're out of time<br>
We're out of luck<br>
We're out of line<br>
Now we're on the borderline we've really gone and done it this time<br>
People say it could never happen here<br>
But this is a strange frontier<br>
<br>
Take your children while you can<br>
But there's nowhere you can run<br>
No more tears and no more fun<br>
Some day soon they'll drop the big one<br>
No more dad and no more mum<br>
<br>
This is a strange frontier
