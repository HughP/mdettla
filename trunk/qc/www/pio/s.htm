<b>SCANDAL</b> <br>
<br>
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know<br>
Scandal - they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show<br>
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see the love break<br>
They'll hear me pleading, We'll say for God's sake<br>
Over and over and over again<br>
<br>
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds<br>
Hey scandal - and all the world can make us out to be fools<br>
Here come the bad news, open the flood gates<br>
They'll leave us bleeding, we'll say you cheapskates<br>
Over and over and over again<br>
<br>
So let them know when they stare it's just a private affair<br>
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care<br>
It's only a life to be twisted and broken<br>
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see our love break - yeah<br>
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake<br>
Over and over and over and over again<br>
<br>
Scandal scandal<br>
<br>
Scandal<br>
Scandal yes you're breaking my heart again<br>
Scandal yes you're loving on out again<br>
<br>
Today the headlines tomorrow hard times<br>
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies<br>
And in the end the story deeper must hide<br>
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside<br>
<br>
Scandal scandal<br>
