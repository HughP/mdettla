<b>STONE COLD CRAZY</b><br>
<br>
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,<br>
I was dreaming I was Al Capone<br>
There's a rumour going round,<br>
Gotta clear out of town<br>
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone<br>
Here comes the law, gonna break down the door,<br>
Gonna carry me away once more<br>
Never never never get it anymore<br>
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor<br>
Crazy<br>
Stone cold crazy, you know<br>
<br>
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and<br>
I'm playing on my slide trombone<br>
Anymore anymore Cannot take it anymore<br>
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor<br>
Crazy<br>
Stone cold crazy, you know<br>
<br>
Walking down the street shooting people that <br>
I meet with my rubber tommy water gun<br>
Here comes the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me<br>
I gotta get me get up and run<br>
They got the sirenes loos<br>
I ran right outa juice<br>
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven,<br>
Will they let me go to hell<br>
Crazy<br>
Stone cold crazy, you know
