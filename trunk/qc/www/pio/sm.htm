<b>Save Me</b><br>
<br>
It started off so well<br>
They said we made a perfect pair<br>
I clothed myself in your glory and your love<br>
How I loved you,<br>
How I cried.....<br>
The years of care and loyalty<br>
Were nothing but a sham it seems<br>
The years belie we lived a lie<br>
"I'll love you 'til I die"<br>
<br>
Save me Save me Save me<br>
I can't face this life alone<br>
Save me Save me Oh...<br>
I'm naked and I'm far from home<br>
<br>
The slate will soon be clean<br>
I'll erase the memories,<br>
To start again with somebody new<br>
Was it all wasted<br>
All that love?.....<br>
I hang my head and I advertise<br>
A soul for sale or rent<br>
I have no heart, I'm cold inside<br>
I have no real intent<br>
<br>
Save me Save me Save me<br>
I can't face this life alone<br>
Save me Save me Oh...<br>
I'm naked and I'm far from home<br>
<br>
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie<br>
I'll love you 'til I die
