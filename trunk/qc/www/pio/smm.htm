<b>SHE MAKES ME (Stormtrooper in Stilletos)</b><br>
<br>
I love she makes me<br>
She is my heart<br>
She is my love<br>
She is my love<br>
<br>
I know you're jealous of her<br>
She makes me need<br>
She is my love<br>
She is my love<br>
<br>
Who knows who she'll make me<br>
As I lie in her cocoon<br>
But the world will surely heal my ills<br>
I'm warm and terrified<br>
She makes me so<br>
<br>
I know the day I leave her<br>
I'd love her still<br>
She is my love<br>
She is my love<br>
<br>
Who knows where my dreams will end<br>
I'll follow as they grow<br>
But the world will know<br>
How long I'll take<br>
And if I'm very slow<br>
She makes me so<br>
She is my love<br>
She is my love
