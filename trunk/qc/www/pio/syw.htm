<b>SPREAD YOUR WINGS</b><br>
<br>
Sammy was low,<br>
just watching the show,<br>
over and over again.<br>
He knew it was time,<br>
he'd made up his mind,<br>
to leave his dead life behind.<br>
<br>
His boss said to him<br>
boy, you'd better begin<br>
to get those crazy notions<br>
right out of your head<br>
Sammy who do you think that you are?<br>
You should have been sweeping,<br>
at the emerald bar.<br>
<br>
spread your wings and fly away,<br>
fly away, far away.<br>
Spread your little wings and fly away<br>
fly away, far away.<br>
Pull yourself together,<br>
'cause you know you should do better,<br>
that's because you're a free man.<br>
<br>
He spends his evenings alone,<br>
in his hotelroom.<br>
Keeping his thoughts to himself,<br>
he'd be leaving soon.<br>
Wishing he was miles and miles away,<br>
nothing in this world, nothing,<br>
would make him stay.<br>
<br>
Since he was small,<br>
had no luck at all,<br>
nothing came easy to him.<br>
Now it was time,<br>
he'd made up his mind,<br>
this could be my last change<br>
His boss said to him<br>
now listen boy,you're always dreaming,<br>
you got no real ambition,<br>
you won't get worried for.<br>
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?<br>
why can't you be happy,<br>
at the emerald bar?<br>
<br>
(So honey) spread you wings and fly away,<br>
fly away, far away.<br>
spread your little wings and fly away,<br>
fly away, far away.<br>
pull yourself together,<br>
'cause you know you should do better,<br>
that's because your a free man.<br>
come on honey (fly with me)...
