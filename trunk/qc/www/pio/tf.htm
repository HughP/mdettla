<b>TENEMENT FUNSTER</b><br>
<br>
My new purple shoes<br>
Bin amazin' the people next door<br>
And my rock'n'roll forty fives<br>
Bin enragin' the folks on the lower floor<br>
<br>
I got a way with the girls on my block<br>
Try my best to be a real individual<br>
And when we go down to smokies and rock<br>
They line up like it's some kind of ritual<br>
Oh give me a good guitar<br>
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace<br>
Or just find me an open car<br>
I'll make the speed of light outa this place<br>
<br>
I like the good things in life<br>
But most of the best things ain't free<br>
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife<br>
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy<br>
Young and you're crazy...<br>
<br>
Oh give me a good guitar<br>
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace<br>
Or just find me an open car<br>
I'll make the speed of light outa this place
