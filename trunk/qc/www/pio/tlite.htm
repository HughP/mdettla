<b>THE LOSER IN THE END</b><br>
<br>
Mama's got a problem<br>
She don't know what to say<br>
Her little baby boy<br>
Has just left home today<br>
She's got to be the loser in the end<br>
She's got to be the loser in the end<br>
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend<br>
She's Ma on who you can always depend ooh<br>
<br>
She washed and fed and clothed and cared<br>
For nearly twenty years<br>
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma<br>
And the night times for her tears<br>
She's got to be the loser in the end<br>
She's got to be the loser in the end<br>
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend<br>
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh<br>
<br>
So listen mothers everywhere<br>
To just one mother's son<br>
You'll get forgotten on the way<br>
If you don't let them have their fun<br>
Forget regrets and just remember<br>
It's not so long since you were young<br>
<br>
You're bound to be the loser in the end<br>
You're bound to be the loser in the end<br>
They'll choose their new shoes<br>
That's not far to bend<br>
You're Ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh
