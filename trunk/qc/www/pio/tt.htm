<b>TEO TORRIATTE (LET US CLING TOGETHER)</b><br>
<br>
When I'm gone<br>
No need to wonder if I ever think of you<br>
The same moon shines<br>
The same wind blows<br>
For both of us and time is but a paper moon<br>
...be not gone<br>
<br>
Though I'm gone<br>
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches yuo<br>
A new life grows<br>
The blossom knows<br>
There's no one else could hold my heart as much as you<br>
...be not gone<br>
<br>
Let us cling together as the years go by<br>
Oh my love, my love<br>
In the quiet of the night<br>
Let our candle always burn<br>
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned<br>
<br>
Teo torriatte konomama iko<br>
Aisuruhito yo<br>
Shizukana yoi ni<br>
Hikario tomoshi<br>
Itoshiki ashieo idaki<br>
<br>
Hear my song<br>
Still think of me the way you've come to think of me<br>
The nights grow long<br>
But dreams live on<br>
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me<br>
...dream on<br>
<br>
When I'm gone<br>
They'd say we're all fools and we don't understand<br>
Oh be strong<br>
Don't turn your heart<br>
You're all<br>
We're all<br>
For all<br>
For always...
