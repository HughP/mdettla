<b>UNDER PRESSURE</b><br>
(Queen &amp; Bowie)<br>
<br>
Pressure  pushing down on me<br>
Pressing  down on you no man ask for<br>
Under  pressure - that burns a building down<br>
Splits a  family in two<br>
Puts people  on streets<br>
It's the  terror of knowing<br>
What this  world is about<br>
Watching  some good friends<br>
Screaming  let me out<br>
Pray  tomorrow - gets me higher<br>
Pressure on  people - people on streets<br>
Chippin'  around - kick my brains around the floor<br>
There are  the days it never rains but it pours<br>
People on  streets - people on streets<br>
It's the  terror of knowing<br>
What this  world is about<br>
Watching  some good friends<br>
Screaming  let me out<br>
Pray  tomorrow - gets me higher<br>
Pressure on  people - people on streets<br>
Turned away  from it all like a blind man<br>
Sat on a  fence but it don't work<br>
Keep coming  up with love but it's so slashed and torn<br>
Why - why -  why<br>
Love<br>
Insanity  laughs under pressure we're cracking<br>
Can't we  give ourselves one more chance<br>
Why can't we  give love one more chance<br>
Why can't we  give love<br>
Cause love's  such an old fashioned word<br>
and love  dares you to care for<br>
The people  on the edge of the night<br>
And love  dares you to change our way of<br>
Caring about  ourselves<br>
This is our  last dance<br>
This is our  last dance<br>
This is  ourselves<br>
Under  pressure<br>
Under  pressure<br>
Pressure
