<b>Who wants to live forever</b><br>
(Brian May)<br>
<br>
There's no  time for us,<br>
There's no place for us,<br>
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.<br>
<br>
Who wants to  live forever,<br>
Who wants to live forever.....?<br>
There's no chance for us,<br>
It's all decidede for us,<br>
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.<br>
<br>
Who wants to  live forever.<br>
Who dares to live forever,<br>
When love must die.<br>
<br>
But touch my  tears with your lips,<br>
Touch my world with your fingertips,<br>
And we can have forever,<br>
And we can love forever,<br>
Forever is our today,<br>
<br>
Who wants to live forever,<br>
Who wants to live forever,<br>
Forever is our today,<br>
Who waits forever anyway?
