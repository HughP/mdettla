<b>YOU AND I</b><br>
<br>
Music is playing in the darkness<br>
And a lantern goes swinging by<br>
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering<br>
Just you and I<br>
Not tonight come tomorrow<br>
When ev'rything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)<br>
No no no come tomorrow 'cause then<br>
We'll be waiting in the moonlight<br>
<br>
We'll go walking in the moonlight<br>
Walking in the moonlight<br>
Laughter ringing in the darkness<br>
People drinking for days gone by<br>
Time don't mean a thing<br>
When you're by my side<br>
Please stay awhile<br>
<br>
You know I never could forsee the future years<br>
You know I never could see<br>
Where life was leading me<br>
But will we be together forever?<br>
What will be my love?<br>
Can't you see that I just don't know<br>
<br>
No not tonight not tomorrow<br>
Ev'rything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright)<br>
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be<br>
As happy as we're feeling tonight<br>
We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy)<br>
Walking in the moonlight<br>
<br>
I can hear the music in the darkness<br>
Floating softly to where we lie<br>
No more questions now<br>
Let's enjoy tonight<br>
(Just you and I) just you and I<br>
Just you and I<br>
Can't you see that we've gotta be together<br>
Be together just you and I just you and I<br>
No more questions just you and I
