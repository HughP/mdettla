<b>YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY</b><br>
<br>
Take it, take it all away<br>
Look into my eyes and you'll see I'm the only one<br>
You've captured my love, stolen my heart,<br>
changed my life<br>
Everytime you make a move you destroy my mind<br>
And the way you touch, I lose control and<br>
shiver deep inside<br>
You take my breath away<br>
<br>
You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh<br>
Every breath that you take, any sound that you make<br>
is a whisper in my ear<br>
I could give up all my life for just one kiss<br>
I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love<br>
You take my breath away<br>
<br>
So please don't go, don't leave me here all by myself<br>
I get ever so lonely from time to time<br>
I will find you anywhere you go<br>
I'll be right behind you<br>
right until the ends of the earth<br>
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you that<br>
you just take my breath away
