Cmi          8xx768         8xx88x
Look into my eyes and you'll see
(8xx10911)   Cmi (~intro)
I'm  the only one

        Bdim        Cmi
You've captured my love
Bdim        Cmi
Stolen my heart
Bb7         Eb
Changed my life

G#/Bb (6x654x)       6x633x 
Everytime you make a move 
               Eb/G (3x534x)
You destroy my mind
                Gbdim (2 x x 4 2-5 4 x)
And the way you touch
         1x314x
I lose control and shiver deep inside

                   Cm (~intro) 
You take my breath away.


You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
Every breath that you take -
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all  my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away.


                Bb-Ab/Bb (6887xx - 6x654x)
So please don't go 
Don't leave me here all by myself
              Eb
I get ever so lonely from time to time

       Ab
I will find you
C                Fm/F-G-Ab
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
4x646x                        Eb/G
Right until the ends of the earth
            (2 x 4 2-5 4 x)           1x314x
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you
         Fm7                 Cm (~intro)
That you just take my breath away.
