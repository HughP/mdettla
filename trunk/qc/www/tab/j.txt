Bm F# Bm
Then I saw him in the crowd
Bm F# Bm
A lot of people had gathered around him
Bm F# Bm
The beggars shouted, the lepers called him
Bm F# Bm
The old man said nothing; he just stared about him
D A G D A G A
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
D A G D A G A
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
D A G F#
All going do - own
