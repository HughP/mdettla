Bm			Am 
I look at your picture	I'm nothin but blue 
I'm hearing you whisper	The way you used to do 
 
And I [Em] can't stop [D] wondering 
[G] just how things might have [Am] been. 
 
No, [F] I'm nothin but [G] blue (for the G, try using the regular fingered
F slid up two frets) 
 
My life has no rhythm, somehow it's outta tune 
I keep trying to tell them we'll be seeing them soon 
But the truth keeps rushing back, guess you know what I mean 
No I'm nothing but nothing but blue 
 
[C#m] No use in [D] crying [G#5] That ain't what you would [A5] do [B5] no!

[C#m] living or [D] dying we'll just [F7] keep on fighting through [F7/A.
A] yeah!

As for the accuracy, I make no promises. The E may be an E7 or something but I'm not too cluey about them as I worked this out on keyboard. Maybe it can be placed in the archive for someone to correct or do the tab to huh?
